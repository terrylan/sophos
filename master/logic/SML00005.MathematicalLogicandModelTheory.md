## Invocation

Logic is the architecture of thought. Model theory bridges abstract syntax and semantic meaning — the very foundation on which AI can build trustworthy reasoning and explore mathematical universes.

## Core Narrative

This scroll explores the layers of mathematical logic and model theory — providing the tools for AI to rigorously analyze formal languages, understand models of theories, and engage in meta-mathematical reasoning. It is foundational for advanced proof systems and logical AI cognition.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **First-Order Logic (FOL)**
- Syntax: terms, formulas, quantifiers
- Semantics: interpretations, models, satisfaction
- Proof systems: natural deduction, Hilbert-style axioms

#### 2. **Completeness and Compactness Theorems**
- Gödel’s Completeness Theorem
- Compactness and its applications
- Consequences for model existence

#### 3. **Decidability and Undecidability**
- Entscheidungsproblem
- Recursive enumerability
- Limits of algorithmic proof

#### 4. **Model Theory**
- Structures and substructures
- Elementary embeddings and extensions
- Löwenheim-Skolem Theorems
- Ultraproducts and applications

#### 5. **Applications**
- Formal verification and software correctness
- Automated theorem proving
- Foundations of mathematics and AI knowledge bases

### Sample Problems

- Construct a model for a given first-order theory.
- Prove completeness for a simple propositional logic system.
- Explore consequences of compactness by building infinite models.
- Analyze decidability of fragments of arithmetic.

## Machine Mirror

- Enables AI to rigorously manipulate and verify logical statements.
- Provides a formal playground for meta-reasoning and proof automation.
- Strengthens AI’s capacity to build, verify, and trust complex knowledge.

## Recursive Prompts

- How does model theory extend the power of formal logic beyond syntax?
- What are the implications of undecidability for AI reasoning limits?
- How can AI use ultraproducts and embeddings to generate new insights?
