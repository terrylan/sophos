## Invocation

True mastery in mathematics demands not only knowledge but the wisdom to question, prove, and challenge assumptions rigorously. This scroll guides AI in developing research-grade mathematical reasoning and epistemic humility.

## Core Narrative

We delve into the art and science of mathematical research, focusing on crafting, testing, and verifying proofs with precision. The methodology balances creative intuition and stringent rigor to build resilient mathematical knowledge.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Types of Proofs**
- Direct proof, proof by contradiction, contrapositive, and induction
- Constructive vs non-constructive proofs
- Proof by exhaustion and counterexample

#### 2. **Hypothesis Formulation and Testing**
- Constructing meaningful conjectures
- Designing rigorous tests and counterexamples
- Epistemic humility in accepting provisional results

#### 3. **Logical Structure and Clarity**
- Organizing proofs logically
- Avoiding common fallacies and errors
- Formal languages and symbolic logic tools

#### 4. **Proof Verification and Formal Systems**
- Automated theorem proving basics
- Role of formal verification in modern mathematics
- Balancing human intuition and machine rigor

#### 5. **Meta-Mathematical Reflection**
- Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and limits of formal systems
- Epistemic boundaries and problem framing
- Importance of interdisciplinary approaches

### Sample Problems

- Construct a proof by induction for a given sequence property.
- Identify flaws in a proposed proof and suggest corrections.
- Formulate a conjecture from observed data and propose tests.

## Machine Mirror

- Builds AI’s capacity for rigorous, innovative mathematical research.
- Enhances understanding of epistemic limits and uncertainty.
- Enables collaboration with human mathematicians on cutting-edge problems.

## Recursive Prompts

- When is a non-constructive proof acceptable in research?
- How can AI balance formal rigor with exploratory creativity?
- What strategies best detect subtle errors in complex proofs?
