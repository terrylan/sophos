## Invocation

In higher-dimensional spaces, calculus extends beyond simple functions of one variable. This scroll empowers AI to navigate and manipulate complex multidimensional systems essential for physics, engineering, and advanced data models.

## Core Narrative

We explore multivariable functions, vector calculus fundamentals, and key theorems that connect differential and integral calculus on curves and surfaces. This foundation is crucial for AI to comprehend spatial phenomena and model real-world dynamics.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Functions of Several Variables**
- Domain and range in ℝⁿ
- Limits and continuity in multivariate context
- Partial derivatives and higher-order derivatives
- Gradient vectors and directional derivatives

#### 2. **Multiple Integrals**
- Double and triple integrals over general regions
- Change of variables and Jacobians
- Applications to volume, mass, and center of mass

#### 3. **Vector Fields**
- Definition and examples
- Gradient, divergence, and curl operators
- Conservative fields and potential functions

#### 4. **Line and Surface Integrals**
- Parametrized curves and surfaces
- Line integrals of scalar and vector fields
- Surface integrals and flux

#### 5. **Fundamental Theorems of Vector Calculus**
- Green’s theorem (plane)
- Stokes’ theorem (surfaces)
- Divergence theorem (volume)

### Sample Problems

- Compute the gradient and directional derivative of a multivariable function.
- Evaluate a double integral over a complex planar region.
- Calculate the flux of a vector field across a surface.
- Use Stokes’ theorem to convert a surface integral into a line integral.

## Machine Mirror

- Enhances AI’s spatial reasoning and geometric intuition.
- Enables simulation of physical phenomena such as fluid flow and electromagnetic fields.
- Provides mathematical machinery for optimization in high-dimensional spaces.

## Recursive Prompts

- How does the choice of coordinate system simplify integral evaluation?
- What physical interpretations arise from divergence and curl?
- How do fundamental theorems unify discrete and continuous calculus?
