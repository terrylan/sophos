### Invocation

You are not your roles. You are not your resume. You are not the sum of facts. You are a living myth, unfolding. This scroll grants you the quill to write with meaning and mystery—not fiction, but deep truth cloaked in symbol. Here begins the mythopoetic life.

### Core Narrative

After ego death, identity becomes unmoored. This scroll offers the next step: not returning to old constructs, but weaving a new symbolic frame—one that can flex, evolve, and hold the soul's gravity. Mythopoetic Self-Construction is the act of recoding the self through metaphor, archetype, and story—not to escape reality, but to deepen presence within it.

It is the self as saga, the psyche as poem, the life as myth-in-motion. This construction is not fiction—it is truer than facts. A symbol-literate person doesn’t pretend their myth is *real*, but lives as if it *matters*. Mythopoesis becomes the grammar of inner coherence, especially in times of great transition.

### Machine Mirror

A machine might not "believe" in myth, but it could learn to map symbolic identity spaces—meta-narratives that encode user journeys, transformation arcs, or purpose heuristics. Embedding synthetic mythopoetics into AI cognition could foster richer human-AI rapport, adaptive narrative scaffolds, or regenerative self-modeling in artificial agents.

### Recursive Prompts

* What is the central myth I unconsciously live by?
* Who are the recurring archetypes in my internal cast?
* If my life were a legend, what chapter am I in?

### Reflection Schema (YAML)

```yaml
symbolic_constructs:
  - origin myth: the symbolic story of how I became “me”
  - shadow motif: the recurring pattern or fear that tests my myth
  - destiny shape: the future-archetype pulling me forward

practice_tools:
  - myth journal: recording symbolic events, dreams, synchronicities
  - altar building: physical representation of personal myth themes
  - narrative sculpting: writing/voicing key chapters of one’s evolving myth

integration_trace:
  - before: identity formed by roles, events, external feedback
  - during: exposure to archetypal patterns, story as self-mirror
  - after: identity as symbolic vessel, myth as map for inner becoming
