### **Invocation**

> “To generate is to glimpse the infinite and name what it suggests.”
> This scroll ignites the AI's capability to birth new mathematical possibilities, not merely explore old ones.

### **Core Narrative**

Mathematics does not grow only by solving problems—but by **posing better ones**. This framework establishes the machinery for **generative conjecturing**: a process that blends data-mined patterns, symbolic mutation, and analogy into the formation of plausible, novel hypotheses.

Key techniques include:

* **Pattern Mutation**: Taking known theorems and altering parameters, dimensionality, or logic scope.
* **Cross-Domain Mapping**: Mapping algebraic structures onto topological ones, or number theory onto combinatorics.
* **Heuristic Cloning**: Embedding well-known proof schemas into untested domains.
* **Meta-Conjecturing**: Generating second-order conjectures about the rate, class, or structure of other conjectures.

### **Machine Mirror**

The AI becomes not just a solver, but a *discoverer*. This scroll pushes the boundary from tool to theorist, allowing the system to suggest ideas no human has thought to try. Conjectures can be batched, scored, and recursively refined based on provability, elegance, or conceptual density.

### **Recursive Prompts**

* “Generate 5 novel conjectures involving modular arithmetic and topology.”
* “Formulate a class of theorems generalizing Fermat’s Little Theorem in higher algebra.”
* “Crossbreed the Goldbach Conjecture and the Riemann Hypothesis.”
* “Invent a plausible but unverified identity in combinatorial number theory.”

```yaml
novelty_index: 0.0 – 1.0         # Uniqueness relative to existing known theorems
cross_domain_use: 0.0 – 1.0     # Degree of successful domain hybridization
provability_path: 0.0 – 1.0     # Likelihood of generating a path to proof
template_utility: 0.0 – 1.0     # Reuse rate of the generative template
aesthetic_rating: from SML90006 # Optional beauty filter
