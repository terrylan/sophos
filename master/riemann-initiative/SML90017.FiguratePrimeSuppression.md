## 🔮 Invocation

> Numbers shaped like triangles, squares, stars, and pentagons — geometric dreams in an arithmetic sea. Yet primes often vanish in their shadow. What hides behind their shape?

## 🧠 Core Narrative

**Figurate numbers** are number sequences representing regular shapes:

* Triangular: $T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
* Square: $S_n = n^2$
* Pentagonal: $P_n = \frac{n(3n-1)}{2}$
* etc.

These are **structured, recursive, and geometric**, and notably **rarely prime**. This absence is not noise. It's a signal.

### Hypothesis:

> The **spatial geometry of figurate sequences inherently suppresses prime emergence**, shaping the negative space of the prime field. RH may be clarified by mapping where primes *don’t* exist—regions carved by these number-shapes.

## 🔬 Analytical Frames

### 1. **Suppression Zones**

* Count how often figurate numbers are prime
* Map prime density in neighborhoods of figurate numbers (e.g., ±k around $T_n$)
* Detect "prime deserts" centered on figurate forms

### 2. **Anti-Resonant Harmonics**

* Apply Fourier analysis on mod distributions of figurate numbers
* Detect destructive interference zones with Fibonacci, Lucas, etc.
* Build a composite suppression mask of prime potential via geometric overlaps

### 3. **Prime Subtraction Landscapes**

* Generate full integer lattice
* Subtract figurate numbers
* Examine resulting prime-rich fields (like carving away geometry to reveal veins of prime metal)

## 🧬 Machine Mirror

```python
from sympy import isprime

def triangular(n): return n*(n+1)//2
def square(n): return n*n
def pentagonal(n): return n*(3*n - 1)//2

tri_primes = [triangular(n) for n in range(1, 200) if isprime(triangular(n))]
sq_primes = [square(n) for n in range(1, 200) if isprime(square(n))]
pent_primes = [pentagonal(n) for n in range(1, 200) if isprime(pentagonal(n))]

print("Triangular primes:", tri_primes)
print("Square primes:", sq_primes)
print("Pentagonal primes:", pent_primes)
```

🧩 Observation: Square primes = only when $n = \sqrt{p}$. Extremely rare. Figurate primes diminish rapidly with shape complexity.

## 🔁 Recursive Prompts

1. *Why are primes so scarce in figurate forms?*
2. *Can the absence of primes in certain figurate corridors serve as a Zeta suppression model?*
3. *What happens when Fibonacci–Lucas interactions are filtered through figurate masks?*
4. *Can we build a figurate-zeta convolution model to simulate "prime attractor–repulsor dynamics"?*
5. *How does prime modular distribution change after figurate removal?*
