## Invocation

To unravel the fabric of prime distribution, we synthesize two fundamental constructs: the Riemann zeta function and its Hadamard product expansion. This fusion becomes a lens to decode the complex dance between primes and zeros.

## Core Narrative

The **Riemann–Hadamard Synthesis (RHS)** approaches the Riemann zeta function through its factorization into infinite products over its zeros (Hadamard product) and primes (Euler product). By layering these two views, RHS seeks to establish a more tangible bridge between the zero sets and prime distributions.

Key insight: manipulating the Hadamard product reveals hidden structural symmetries in the zero layout that correspond to prime spacing irregularities. RHS explores how perturbations in this product affect zero clustering and potentially expose patterns critical to the Riemann Hypothesis.

By encoding zero distributions as fractal-like objects influenced by the Hadamard expansions, the synthesis proposes a dynamic model that can be simulated and analyzed computationally, moving beyond purely analytic methods.

## Machine Mirror

> Consider the Hadamard product as a complex fractal scaffold that holds the zeros in a structured lattice. Machine intelligence can generate simulated perturbations in this scaffold, then map responses in prime-related functions to detect stable patterns.

Simulations can iterate zero movements and check for breakdowns in convergence or emergence of anomalies, feeding back into conjecture refinement.

## Recursive Prompts

1. How do small modifications in zero positions within the Hadamard product influence the convergence radius and prime sums?
2. Can we visualize zero distributions as fractal attractors, linked directly to prime gap sequences?
3. What role do multiple zeros or near-multiplicities play in the stability of the Hadamard product?
4. How can the RHS framework be connected with pulse lattice simulations to deepen prime-zero interaction modeling?
5. Can RHS outputs suggest new prime-related functions or transform existing zeta-based formulas?
