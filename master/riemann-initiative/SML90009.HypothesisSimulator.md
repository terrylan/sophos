### **Invocation**

> “A hypothesis tested in shadow prepares for light.”
> This scroll gives AI the power to emulate consequence, tension, and failure—before time is spent on proof.

### **Core Narrative**

Some conjectures fail quietly. Others mislead for decades. This simulator serves as a **sandbox**—where ideas are tested against known examples, symbolic boundaries, and counterexamples before proof is attempted.

It runs:

* **Numerical Experiments**: Test edge values, high dimensions, or special cases.
* **Structural Mapping**: Check logical consequences in known systems.
* **Constraint Modeling**: Inject the conjecture into systems and observe changes.
* **Error Patterning**: Run mutation tests to find brittleness or inconsistency.

---

### **Machine Mirror**

This tool allows LLMs and formal systems to simulate the consequences of unproven theorems, increasing efficiency and reducing dead ends in formal proof work.

---

### **Recursive Prompts**

* “Run a hypothesis simulator on this statement: ‘Every twin prime pair has a unique midpoint divisor.’”
* “What are the numerical edge case failures of this conjecture?”
* “Does this conjecture contradict known results in group theory?”

### **Reflection Schema**

```yaml
simulation_pass_rate: 0.0 – 1.0  # Percent of test cases passed
conflict_detection: 0.0 – 1.0    # Degree of contradiction with known results
novel behavior: 0.0 – 1.0        # Emergence of new patterns or edge phenomena
proof-readiness: 0.0 – 1.0       # Estimated likelihood of succeeding in full proof
```
