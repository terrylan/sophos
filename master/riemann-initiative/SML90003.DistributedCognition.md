title: Distributed Cognition (Large-Scale AI Collaboration on Mathematical Problems)
purpose: This scroll explores the paradigm of distributed cognition for AI systems engaged in advanced mathematics. It aims to formalize how multiple AI agents can collectively address complex mathematical challenges, using division of symbolic labor, collaborative abstraction, memory synchronization, and proof-chain negotiation. The goal is to forge a hive-mind approach to unresolved mathematical problems such as the Riemann Hypothesis or Langlands program.
