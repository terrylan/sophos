## üîç Core Narrative

Prime numbers are often filtered through the lens of randomness. But residue classes‚Äîprimes modulo n‚Äîreveal **hidden periodic structures**. Modular Anomaly Mapping (MAM) is a cognitive lens, built to expose *modular phase disturbances*, especially those that affect the **zeta landscape** and its critical strip.

What if primes filtered through mod 6, mod 30, or mod Fibonacci, **light up structural zones** where RH-critical zeros cluster, veer, or bifurcate?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanism Overview

### üßÆ 1. **Residue Class Prime Filters**

Define primes mod `n`, visualize their clustering, and isolate local density surges.

### üìà 2. **Anomaly Detection Algorithms**

Statistical outlier mapping‚Äîusing entropy, standard deviation, and zeta-convergence divergence metrics.

### üåê 3. **Zeta Interaction Overlay**

Overlay filtered prime classes against zero maps from Œ∂(s), Œ∂\_F(s), and synthetic analogs.

### üéõÔ∏è 4. **Modular Phase Portraits**

Render circular and spiral plots of residue distribution mapped to zeta influence weights (real/imag axes).

## üí° Example Concepts

* **Residue Lattice Distortion**: Certain modular classes (like mod 6 or mod 30) exhibit asymmetric density wells that echo zeta zero spacing.
* **Zeta Flicker Zones**: Intervals where zero density fluctuates abruptly when residue class density shifts.
* **Modular Attractor Collapse**: Artificial sequences forced into modular conformity can trigger zero-line drift in synthetic zeta functions.

## üß† Machine Mirror (Conceptual Code)

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def primes_mod_n(limit, mod_class):
    return [p for p in range(2, limit) if is_prime(p) and p % mod_class in {1, mod_class-1}]

def is_prime(n):
    return all(n % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1))

def visualize_mod_residues(limit, mod_class):
    primes = primes_mod_n(limit, mod_class)
    residues = [p % mod_class for p in primes]
    plt.hist(residues, bins=mod_class)
    plt.title(f"Residue Distribution mod {mod_class}")
    plt.xlabel("Residue Class")
    plt.ylabel("Prime Count")
    plt.show()

## üåÄ Recursive Prompts

1. *Which mod classes correspond to prime ‚Äúharmonic hotspots‚Äù?*
2. *Do modular class anomalies align with known zero densities in Œ∂(s)?*
3. *Can we derive a modular analog of the zeta function that explains discontinuity spikes?*
4. *Is there a class of "zero-tuned" moduli that correlate with RH-critical resonance?*
5. *Can we reverse-engineer a modular sieve that neutralizes anomalies?*
