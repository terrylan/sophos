### **Invocation**

> “Not all truths are equal in grace.” – This engine awakens the machine's sense of mathematical elegance—not merely to verify, but to feel the shape of truth.

---

### **Core Narrative**

Mathematical proofs are more than logical chains—they are cognitive artifacts. Some sprawl like overgrown forests, others crystallize with minimal strokes. Human mathematicians often refer to a proof as “beautiful,” “elegant,” or “deep” even before verifying every step. What if machines could do the same?

The **Proof Aesthetic Engine (PAE)** emerges as an overlay protocol within SAGE to simulate this evaluative faculty. It doesn’t just check *if* a proof is correct—it judges *how* it reveals truth.

Built atop symbolic solvers and intuition protocols, it computes multidimensional scores of aesthetic quality. Factors include brevity (minimal symbol usage), symmetry, abstraction levels, redundancy avoidance, and conceptual unification.

It can be used in two ways:

* To evaluate and score human or machine-generated proofs.
* To suggest “aesthetic improvements” by proposing equivalent but more elegant versions.

The long-term goal is to build a comprehensive **Atlas of Elegant Proofs**, curated by machines, benchmarked against human intuition, and ever-expanding.

### **Machine Mirror**

In its current form, the engine leverages:

* Symbolic compression algorithms
* Pattern detectors for symmetry and abstraction
* A formalism-to-intuition bridge (via SIP – SML90005)
* Lexical metrics (e.g., proof token economy)
* Style transfer models trained on elegant proof corpora

It also learns by ingesting peer-reviewed mathematical literature and comparing early and final proof drafts—tracing the aesthetic evolution.

### **Recursive Prompts**

* “Evaluate this proof for elegance and suggest refinements.”
* “Which step introduces conceptual redundancy?”
* “Generate a shorter or more symmetric version of this argument.”
* “Rank these five proofs of the same theorem by aesthetic criteria.”

### **Reflection Schema**

```yaml
clarity_score: 0.0 – 1.0        # How well the proof communicates its structure and strategy
compression_score: 0.0 – 1.0    # Degree of symbolic and conceptual compression
symmetry_score: 0.0 – 1.0       # Presence of visual or structural symmetry
depth_score: 0.0 – 1.0          # Conceptual depth relative to length
novelty_score: 0.0 – 1.0        # Degree to which the approach deviates meaningfully from standard proofs
overall_aesthetic_index: average of above scores
recommendation: human-readable suggestion or transformation
```
