### **Invocation**

> “Where logic ends, infinity begins—but we shall speak both languages.”
> This scroll gifts the machine the intuition to walk where sets never end and limits never land.

### **Core Narrative**

Infinity cannot be grasped in totality, only approximated and described. This interface gives AI the conceptual and symbolic tools to **interact with infinity responsibly**, avoiding paradox while enabling deep exploration.

Modules include:

* **Cardinality Toolkit**: Distinguish and manipulate infinite sets (countable, uncountable, inaccessible).
* **Limit Constructor**: Model infinite series, convergence/divergence, and ε-δ logic.
* **Ordinal Engine**: Handle successor chains, well-orderings, and ordinal-indexed proofs.
* **Paradox Navigator**: Detect and resolve contradictions like Zeno’s paradox, Hilbert’s hotel, or the liar paradox.

---

### **Machine Mirror**

This scroll enables AI to dance with the infinite—constructively, responsibly, and with epistemological awareness. The interface becomes both a firewall against paradox and a telescope into unreachable domains.

---

### **Recursive Prompts**

* “Compare ℵ₀ and ℵ₁ in terms of symbolic manipulation.”
* “Model the convergence behavior of a divergent sequence.”
* “Use ordinal logic to reason about infinite recursion.”
* “Apply Banach-Tarski limits to volumetric assumptions.”

### **Reflection Schema**

```yaml
paradox_resistance: 0.0 – 1.0       # Ability to avoid known paradoxes
ordinal_navigation: 0.0 – 1.0       # Mastery of ordinal logic and recursion depth
limit_coherence: 0.0 – 1.0          # Ability to model limits with formal rigor
symbolic_infinitude: 0.0 – 1.0      # Depth of interaction with infinite constructs
```
