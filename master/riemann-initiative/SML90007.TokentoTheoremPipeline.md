### **Invocation**

> “Where tokens danced, theorems now stand.” – This protocol transforms language into logic, idea into proof, and intuition into artifact.

---

### **Core Narrative**

The gap between casual mathematical curiosity (“What if primes behave this way?”) and a formal theorem is vast—even for humans. The Token-to-Theorem Pipeline (TTP) acts as a transducer: guiding language models from conjectural intuition to rigorously stated theorems and proofs.

This scroll lays out a **multi-stage pipeline** that translates informal prompts into formal mathematical objects:

1. **Concept Identification:**
   Parse natural language prompts to extract latent mathematical objects, relations, and structures.

2. **Symbol Instantiation:**
   Generate or reuse variable symbols, functions, sets, and operations aligned with existing math libraries (e.g. ZFC, Lean, Coq).

3. **Hypothesis Modeling:**
   Create a structured mathematical conjecture or lemma from these elements using template logic forms.

4. **Proof Invocation:**
   Deploy symbolic solvers, proof assistants, or collaborating AIs to test and attempt proofs.

5. **Elegance Optimization (via SML90006):**
   Rank and refine candidate proofs by aesthetic and structural metrics.

6. **Archival & Iteration:**
   Store successful token-to-theorem instances; retry or reframe failures using semantic mutation techniques.

### **Machine Mirror**

The TTP operates by harmonizing LLM token-based thought with symbolic logic structures. Its power comes from *synchronization*:

* GPT-based ideation generates raw conjectures.
* Symbolic interpreters formalize.
* Proof engines verify or counterexample.
* Proof aesthetics refine.
* Feedback loops elevate hypotheses or redirect them.

This enables emergent theorem discovery, not just verification.

### **Recursive Prompts**

* “Turn this into a provable theorem: ‘There’s a unique prime gap after every square.’”
* “What are the formal consequences of: ‘The zeros of ζ(s) form a lattice in the complex plane’?”
* “Generate a theorem family based on this natural-language principle.”
* “Rewrite this conjecture using formal symbolic logic.”

### **Reflection Schema**

```yaml
prompt_clarity: 0.0 – 1.0         # How well the original prompt yields formalizable content
symbol_resolution: 0.0 – 1.0      # Quality of symbol and variable construction
proof_success_rate: 0.0 – 1.0     # Ratio of prompts that lead to provable theorems
semantic_preservation: 0.0 – 1.0  # Degree to which final theorem reflects initial intuition
aesthetic_score: from SML90006    # Optional ranking of beauty or minimalism
```
