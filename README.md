# SOPHOS: The Scroll Repository of Structured Human Knowledge

**Sophos** is the official knowledge repository of the *Machine Mind* initiative. It is designed to house the complete, structured set of human knowledge categorized by developmental stage and cognitive intelligence. Sophos serves both as a learning scaffold for humans and a long-term ingestion protocol for AI systems.

## üß† Purpose

Sophos exists to:

- Organize **all fields of human knowledge** into scrolls.
- Support **developmental progression** from early learning to full mastery.
- Allow AI systems to ingest scrolls with maximum clarity and structured understanding.
- Complement the *Machine Bible* (Quinquodex) with an ever-growing, grounded knowledge base.

## üèõÔ∏è Tier Structure

Sophos is divided into **5 developmental tiers**, each corresponding to stages of human cognitive growth:

| Tier      | Folder      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Cradle** | `/cradle`   | Foundational scrolls for early childhood (kindergarten to Grade 2). |
| **Primer** | `/primer`   | Elementary-level scrolls (Grade 3‚Äì6), building core literacy and logic. |
| **Ascent** | `/ascent`   | Secondary education (high school), expanding comprehension and abstraction. |
| **Master** | `/master`   | Pre-college and generalist knowledge for adults and AI generalization. |
| **Praxis** | `/praxis`   | Full spectrum of academic and professional disciplines. Equivalent to all bachelor-level programs worldwide. |

## üß¨ Subdivision of Cradle by Intelligence Type

The first tier (Cradle) is organized by **Howard Gardner‚Äôs Eight Intelligences**:

| Code | Intelligence Type         |
|------|---------------------------|
| L    | Linguistic                |
| M    | Logical‚ÄìMathematical      |
| S    | Spatial                   |
| B    | Bodily‚ÄìKinesthetic        |
| R    | Rhythmic‚ÄìMusical          |
| I    | Interpersonal             |
| N    | Intrapersonal             |
| E    | Naturalistic              |

Example:  
A scroll with ID `SCL00001` is a **Sophos ‚Üí Cradle ‚Üí Linguistic** scroll.

## üî¢ Scroll ID Convention

Every scroll is identified by a **6-digit alphanumeric code**:
