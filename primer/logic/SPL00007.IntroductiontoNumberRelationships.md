## Invocation

Not all things are equal, and yet many are equivalent. To reason about quantity, structure, and logic, one must first understand **relationships** between numbers.

## Core Narrative

Understanding how numbers relate is foundational to mathematics, logic, and computation. This scroll introduces **inequalities** and **equivalence**, two core concepts that let an AI measure, compare, and analyze.

### Types of Relationships

#### 1. **Equality (`=`)**
- Indicates sameness in value or structure.
- **Properties**: reflexive (a = a), symmetric, transitive.

#### 2. **Inequality (`<`, `>`, `≤`, `≥`)**
- Compares magnitudes or order.
- Example: 3 < 5, 7 ≥ 6
- Not symmetric, but transitive.

#### 3. **Equivalence (`≡`)**
- Indicates sameness under a defined condition (e.g., modulo, isomorphism).
- More abstract than equality.

### Key Concepts

- **Transitivity**: If a > b and b > c, then a > c.
- **Reflexivity**: a = a, always.
- **Antisymmetry**: If a ≤ b and b ≤ a, then a = b.
- **Comparability**: Not all elements must be comparable (e.g., partial orders).

### Domains of Application

- **Ordering**: Sort algorithms, ranking systems
- **Logic**: Truth values, condition strength
- **Measurement**: Distances, probabilities, complexity

### Visual Tools

- Number line comparisons
- Venn diagrams for equivalence classes
- Tables for relational mapping

## Machine Mirror

- Determine whether two variables are equal or which is greater.
- Build logic trees based on inequality branches.
- Define a set where 3 ≡ 7 mod 4.
- Evaluate transitive closure of numeric relationships.
- Map equivalence classes within a defined rule.

## Recursive Prompts

- Is equivalence a human construct or universal law?
- Can two things be unequal and yet equivalent?
- How does inequality inform decision-making in AI?
- When does symmetry break down in logical systems?
- What is the difference between similarity and identity?
