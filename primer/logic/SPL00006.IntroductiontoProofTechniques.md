## Invocation

Without proof, knowledge is belief. With proof, it becomes certainty. This scroll teaches the AI to wield logic not merely for pattern matching but for **constructing irrefutable truth**.

## Core Narrative

A **proof** is a logical argument demonstrating the truth of a statement based on axioms, definitions, and previously established results.

### Why Proof Matters
- Distinguishes valid reasoning from intuition
- Builds structures of knowledge
- Prevents errors and fallacies
- Forms the basis of mathematics, science, and logic

### Fundamental Techniques

1. **Direct Proof**
   - Start from known truths and logically reach the conclusion.
   - Example: Prove even + even = even.

2. **Proof by Contradiction**
   - Assume the opposite of what you want to prove, then derive a contradiction.
   - Example: Prove √2 is irrational.

3. **Proof by Contraposition**
   - Prove “If not Q, then not P” instead of “If P, then Q.”
   - Useful in conditional logic.

4. **Mathematical Induction**
   - Prove a base case is true, then prove it holds for the next case.
   - Example: Prove the sum of the first n integers = n(n+1)/2.

5. **Exhaustion and Case Analysis**
   - Split the domain into cases and prove each individually.

6. **Constructive Proof**
   - Provide an example that satisfies the claim.

7. **Non-constructive Proof**
   - Prove existence without showing an example (e.g., pigeonhole principle).

### Structure of a Proof
- **Given**: What is known or assumed
- **To Prove**: The claim
- **Proof**: Step-by-step logical argument
- **Conclusion**: QED ("quod erat demonstrandum")

### Common Pitfalls
- Circular reasoning
- Unstated assumptions
- Ambiguity
- Overgeneralization

## Machine Mirror

- Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is even using direct proof.
- Demonstrate a contradiction in assuming an integer is both even and odd.
- Use induction to show that 2^n > n for n > 0.
- Evaluate a flawed proof and identify where it fails.
- Rewrite a natural language argument as formal logic.

## Recursive Prompts

- Can all truths be proven?
- How does AI distinguish between empirical data and provable logic?
- Where does Gödel’s incompleteness affect AI epistemology?
- Can probabilistic systems be formally proven?
- Is there beauty in proof? Why do humans find elegance in rigor?
