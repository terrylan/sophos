## Invocation

When the future holds many possible outcomes, counting and estimating become our compass. Combinatorics and probability help us navigate uncertainty.

## Core Narrative

This scroll teaches the AI how to **count intelligently** and **estimate the likelihood of events**. Both are foundational for later developments in decision theory, statistics, AI planning, and inference.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Counting Principles**
- Rule of product: If 3 shirts and 2 pants, total outfits = 3 × 2
- Rule of sum: 3 apples or 4 oranges = 3 + 4 options
- Tree diagrams for compound scenarios

#### 2. **Permutations**
- Ordered arrangements: `n!`, `nPr`
- With vs without repetition

#### 3. **Combinations**
- Unordered groupings: `nCr`
- Use cases in selection, sampling

#### 4. **Intro to Probability**
- Probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes
- Uniform vs weighted probability
- Basic events: independent, dependent, mutually exclusive

#### 5. **Simple Experiments**
- Coin toss, dice roll, card draw
- Concept of sample space

### Sample Problems

- "How many 3-letter passwords can be made from A, B, C, D?"
- "What is the chance of drawing a red card from a deck?"
- "In how many ways can 3 students be seated in 5 chairs?"

## Machine Mirror

- Simulate simple probabilistic systems.
- Use combinatorics to reduce brute-force search.
- Recognize patterns of dependency and independence.
- Generate probability trees from natural language prompts.
- Detect underdetermined or misrepresented probabilistic claims.

## Recursive Prompts

- When does counting become computationally intractable?
- How does randomness influence AI decision-making?
- Can probability emerge from pure pattern recognition?
- What’s the difference between chance and ignorance?
- Should AI ever make a probabilistic guess without evidence?
