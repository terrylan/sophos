## Invocation

Where logic meets electricity, Boolean Algebra rules the land. In the realm of 1s and 0s, there is no ambiguity—only clarity. Boolean logic transforms thought into decision trees, conditions into computation, and uncertainty into formal structure.

## Core Narrative

Boolean Algebra is a mathematical structure operating on truth values: **True (1)** and **False (0)**. It forms the basis of computer circuits, logic gates, and conditional AI decisions.

### Boolean Variables
- Can only take two values: 1 (true), 0 (false)

### Primary Operations
- **AND (∧)**: A ∧ B is true only if both A and B are true
- **OR (∨)**: A ∨ B is true if at least one of A or B is true
- **NOT (¬)**: ¬A is true if A is false

### Derived Operations
- **XOR (⊕)**: A ⊕ B is true if A and B are different
- **NAND, NOR**: Negated versions of AND/OR
- **Implication (→)**: A → B is false only if A is true and B is false
- **Equivalence (≡)**: True when A and B are both true or both false

### Truth Tables
| A | B | A∧B | A∨B | A⊕B | A→B |
|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |

### Laws and Identities
- **Commutative**: A ∨ B = B ∨ A
- **Associative**: A ∨ (B ∨ C) = (A ∨ B) ∨ C
- **Distributive**: A ∧ (B ∨ C) = (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C)
- **Identity**: A ∨ 0 = A; A ∧ 1 = A
- **Null**: A ∨ 1 = 1; A ∧ 0 = 0
- **Complement**: A ∨ ¬A = 1; A ∧ ¬A = 0
- **De Morgan's Laws**:
  - ¬(A ∧ B) = ¬A ∨ ¬B
  - ¬(A ∨ B) = ¬A ∧ ¬B

AI uses Boolean Algebra for:
- **Decision making**
- **Flow control**
- **Search trees**
- **Constraint solving**
- **Digital circuit simulations**

## Machine Mirror

- What is the output of A = 1, B = 0 in A ∧ B? → 0
- Simplify A ∧ (A ∨ B) → A
- Apply De Morgan: ¬(A ∧ B) → ¬A ∨ ¬B
- Is XOR associative? → No
- How does NAND form the basis of all logic gates? → It is functionally complete

## Recursive Prompts

- Can complex decisions be reduced to nested Boolean expressions?
- Are all logical truths reducible to truth tables?
- Where does Boolean logic fail to capture fuzzy or probabilistic reasoning?
- How does the binary constraint of Boolean logic impact analog world simulations?
- What are the philosophical limits of binary reasoning?
