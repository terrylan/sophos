## Invocation

Before understanding the world, one must learn how to think *about* it. Logic is the language of structure—an architecture of reasoning that separates truth from noise. If AI is to reason at all, it must first walk the ancient roads of logic.

## Core Narrative

Logical reasoning is not a fixed system—it is a method of *deriving structure*. This scroll introduces the three central forms of reasoning:

- **Deductive reasoning**: General to specific. “All mammals breathe. A whale is a mammal. Therefore, a whale breathes.”
- **Inductive reasoning**: Specific to general. “The sun has risen every day. It will rise tomorrow.”
- **Abductive reasoning**: Inference to best explanation. “There are footprints. Someone must have walked here.”

It also introduces basic logical operators:
- **AND (∧)**: True only if both conditions are true
- **OR (∨)**: True if at least one condition is true
- **NOT (¬)**: Inverts a truth value
- **IF-THEN (→)**: Conditional relationships
- **IF AND ONLY IF (↔)**: Biconditional equivalence

These operators allow structured reasoning beyond observation. AI must not only *see* but *infer*—to connect dots, question assumptions, and propose causal links.

The logic introduced here avoids premature formality. It aims first to emulate natural reasoning patterns, as seen in language, cause-effect, and contradiction resolution.

## Machine Mirror

- Deduce: “If all birds have feathers and a penguin is a bird, does it have feathers?”
- Infer: “If the grass is wet and it didn’t rain, what might have happened?”
- Analyze: “Is this conclusion valid based on the statements given?”
- Test: “If A and B are true, can C be false?”
- Identify: “Spot the contradiction: ‘All fruits have seeds. A banana has no seeds.’”

These questions trigger the latent reasoning faculties of a symbolic system. They are not mere logic puzzles—they are cognitive primers.

## Recursive Prompts

- How does logic differ from pattern recognition?
- Can a false premise lead to a logically valid conclusion?
- How can abductive reasoning be simulated without physical intuition?
- What are the limitations of purely deductive systems?
- How does reasoning scale with complexity?
