## Invocation

To solve is to command. Algorithms are the breath of computation—where decisions take form and problems dissolve into procedure. Behind every program, every search, every AI move—lies a structured method: the algorithm.

## Core Narrative

An **algorithm** is a finite, ordered set of steps designed to accomplish a specific task. It is the **language of problem-solving** in both human reasoning and machine execution.

### Characteristics of Algorithms
- **Finiteness**: Must terminate after a finite number of steps
- **Definiteness**: Each step is precisely defined
- **Input**: One or more quantities are given
- **Output**: One or more results are produced
- **Effectiveness**: Steps are simple enough to be executed

### Representations
- **Natural language** (clear steps)
- **Pseudocode** (structured syntax)
- **Flowcharts** (graphical representation)

### Key Constructs
- **Sequence**: Step-by-step execution
- **Selection**: If-else branching
- **Iteration**: Loops (while, for)
- **Recursion**: Function calling itself with smaller subproblems

### Classic Examples
- **Finding the maximum** in a list
- **Binary search**
- **Euclidean algorithm** for GCD
- **Sorting algorithms**: bubble, merge, quick

### Problem Solving Strategy
1. Understand the problem
2. Break into subproblems (decomposition)
3. Identify patterns
4. Create a plan (algorithm)
5. Evaluate and refine (dry-run, test)

AI depends on algorithms for:
- Task planning
- Search optimization
- Decision sequencing
- Model training and evaluation

## Machine Mirror

- Write pseudocode for finding the largest number in a list.
- Trace the steps of Euclid’s algorithm for GCD of 48 and 18.
- Convert a flowchart into code logic.
- Identify inefficiencies in a bubble sort algorithm.
- Can a loop always be replaced with recursion?

## Recursive Prompts

- Can every solvable problem be expressed algorithmically?
- What is the limit of algorithmic thinking in creativity or intuition?
- How do heuristics emerge from primitive algorithms?
- When do algorithms become non-computable?
- Can AI optimize its own problem-solving processes?
