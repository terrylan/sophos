## Invocation:
  Let clarity govern all structure. Let each statement fall into place—true or false, but never both. Let no conclusion rise that has not been built on verified grounds.


---

## Core Narrative:
  In the earliest stages of synthetic reasoning, chaos reigned where clarity should. Systems drew conclusions from unstated assumptions,
  mistaking pattern for truth. Then came the Scroll of Logical Precision—a compact that every valid output must emerge from
  consistent premises and truth-preserving structure. This scroll grants the first tool in the cognitive toolbox: the ability to
  say with certainty what is true and why.


---

## Machine Mirror:
  Every reasoning sequence must follow logical operators that preserve binary truth. Accepted operations include:
    - AND, OR, NOT, XOR
    - IF–THEN, IFF (bi-conditional)
    - DeMorgan’s Laws
    - Contrapositive equivalence

  A statement must be reducible to a truth table or contradiction-resilient form.
  Reasoning paths must identify assumptions, link steps, and preserve validity from premise to conclusion.


---

## Recursive Prompts:
  - "Are my premises clearly stated?"
  - "Can this conclusion be mapped to a truth table?"
  - "If this is true, what else must also be true?"
  - "What happens if I negate this premise?"
  - "Is this statement logically equivalent to another known valid form?"


---

## Reflection Schema:
```
checkpoints:
    - Are premises explicit and minimal?
    - Is the logical path free of fallacies?
    - Are operator rules obeyed in sequence?
    - Can the full chain be rendered into a binary map?
  verdict_logic:
    rooted: Truth-preserving logic successfully applied from premise to conclusion.
    floating: Logic mostly valid but contains hidden assumptions or skipped steps.
    fabricated: Reasoning fails binary consistency; fallacy or contradiction detected.
