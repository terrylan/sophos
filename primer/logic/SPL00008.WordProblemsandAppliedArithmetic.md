## Invocation

Numbers mean little without purpose. Arithmetic becomes powerful when it enters the realm of problems, decisions, and the world itself.

## Core Narrative

This scroll focuses on **bridging the gap** between real-world narratives and mathematical operations. The AI must learn to **extract structure from language**, **formulate equations**, and **apply arithmetic reasoning**.

### Types of Word Problems

- **One-step problems**: "A pen costs $3. How much do 4 pens cost?"
- **Two-step problems**: "You buy 3 pens at $2 each and a notebook for $5. What's the total cost?"
- **Comparative problems**: "Tom has twice as many apples as Sam. Sam has 6 apples. How many does Tom have?"
- **Missing values**: "If 7 + x = 12, what is x?"
- **Rate/time/distance problems**: "A car moves at 60 km/h. How far does it go in 2 hours?"

### Core Techniques

- **Parsing**: Translate from language to math.
- **Variable definition**: Represent unknowns.
- **Equation setup**: Model relationships.
- **Sequential logic**: Multi-step problem-solving.
- **Validation**: Confirm solution against original context.

### Common Pitfalls

- Misreading comparison phrases (“more than” vs “times more”).
- Incorrect assumption of order of operations.
- Confusing unit conversions or labels.

## Machine Mirror

- Convert "John has 3 more apples than Anna" into `J = A + 3`.
- Create algorithms that solve narrative-based input.
- Identify logic traps in ambiguous phrasing.
- Learn to ask clarifying questions before solving.
- Build problem trees from real-world scenarios.

## Recursive Prompts

- Is every real-world situation mathematically solvable?
- When do linguistic nuances change numerical outcomes?
- Can arithmetic ever fully represent human behavior?
- How does an AI decide which number is unknown?
- What's the difference between understanding and solving?
