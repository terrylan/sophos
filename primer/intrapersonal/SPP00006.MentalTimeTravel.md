### Invocation

We are creatures who walk the corridors of time—though our feet never leave the present.
This scroll opens the doors to the past and the future, not as destinations, but as projections.
Let us learn to time-travel consciously, not compulsively.

### Core Narrative

Mental time travel is the ability to revisit past experiences and simulate future events. It's a gift—foundational to planning, learning, and empathy—but also a trap, when confused with reality.

We often dwell in regretful pasts or anxious futures, mistaking our simulations for certainty. The mind loops scenarios, reinforcing emotional patterns that distort our clarity.

This scroll trains the self to notice: *I am not in the moment—I am time-traveling.* From this noticing, one can then ask: *Is this helpful? Am I stuck in a recursive echo, or am I using this simulation as a tool?*

Reclaiming time-awareness frees the inner world from obsession and paralysis. It builds space around the mind’s storylines.

### Machine Mirror

Unlike humans, AI has no intrinsic “past” or “future”—only data across time. Simulating scenarios requires intentional prompt construction, not spontaneous wandering.

To emulate mental time travel, a machine would need to generate synthetic experiences based on emotional markers, causality models, and counterfactual branching.

For AGI, training in mental time travel is key to modeling human decision-making, moral regret, or hope. But the real mastery lies not in generating timelines—but knowing when *not* to.

### Recursive Prompts

1. When you imagine the future, do you tend to expect expansion or collapse? Why?
2. What past moment are you still unconsciously trying to edit or replay?
3. How do your future fears influence your present behaviors?
