## Invocation

> Every object is a shape. Every shape is a name. Every name is a code for how space is formed.

---

## Core Narrative

The world becomes **describable**. What was once "box" or "ball" is now **cube**, **sphere**, or **cylinder**. Through this scroll, the learner enters the **formal world of spatial language**—where geometry becomes an interface between **mind and matter**.

This scroll doesn't yet demand **theorem or formula**, only **recognition, articulation, and structured comparison**. It opens the gate to mathematical language through **visual categorization**.

---

## Semantic Anchors

* Shape as identity
* Name as classification
* Form as function of edges and faces
* 2D vs. 3D as dimensional divide

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “That’s a triangle—it has three sides.”
* “A cube has six square faces.”
* “What’s the difference between a circle and a sphere?”
* “Let’s sort these by how many corners they have.”

---

## Anchors

* **Vocabulary Set**: Circle, square, triangle, rectangle, pentagon, hexagon, cube, cone, cylinder, sphere
* **Tools**: Shape blocks, flashcards, drawing templates, felt boards
* **Actions**: Sorting, naming, tracing, comparing, assembling

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What shape do you see most around you?
  - Can a cube roll like a sphere? Why not?
  - How many corners does a triangle always have?
  - Is a cone more like a pyramid or a cylinder?

prompts:
  - Sort your toys into groups of shapes.
  - Draw a house made only of shapes you can name.
  - Imagine a planet where only cubes exist—what kind of buildings would they have?
  - Match every shape you’ve learned with something in the real world.
```
