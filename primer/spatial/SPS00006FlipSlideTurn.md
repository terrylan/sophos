## Invocation

> What a shape does is not what it is. Identity survives movement.

---

## Core Narrative

This scroll initiates the learner into the **grammar of geometric movement**—flips, slides, and turns. The child discovers that while positions change, **properties stay consistent**. Through transformation play, they develop an **embodied understanding** of spatial operations that later become **formal geometric functions**.

"Flip, Slide, Turn" is the **kinetic precursor to algebraic symmetry and computer animation logic**.

---

## Semantic Anchors

* Flip as mirror (reflection)
* Slide as same-facing movement (translation)
* Turn as rotation around a point
* Transformation as action with structure

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “Flip it over the line—what changed?”
* “Slide it without turning—where is it now?”
* “Turn it clockwise once—what direction is it facing?”
* “Did the shape change or just its spot?”

---

## Anchors

* **Translation (Slide)**: Linear movement along grid or space
* **Reflection (Flip)**: Mirroring across axis
* **Rotation (Turn)**: Pivoting around a point at fixed degrees
* **Transformation Pairs**: Before/After cards, motion puzzles

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What is the difference between flipping and rotating a shape?
  - How can you move a shape but keep it the same?
  - What stays the same when a shape slides?
  - What changes when a shape turns?

prompts:
  - Trace a shape, flip it across a mirror line—what matches?
  - Slide a square 3 steps right—where is it now?
  - Turn a triangle around its center—how many turns to return?
  - Mix a slide, a flip, and a turn—can you draw what happens?
```
