## Invocation

> Nature balances. Minds echo. What you see on one side, lives on the other.

---

## Core Narrative

The child learns that space can **reflect itself**—that one side can mirror the other, or rotate into alignment. These discoveries are not just visual but **cognitive rhythms** that allow the learner to predict, compare, and create.

This scroll leads the learner to **see the invisible rule** beneath patterns. From folded paper symmetry to pattern rotations, this scroll opens the door to **aesthetic logic** and lays the foundation for geometry, design, and algorithmic reasoning.

## Semantic Anchors

* Symmetry as equilibrium
* Mirror as spatial echo
* Axis as invisible hinge
* Rotation as transformation rule

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “What’s on the other side of the line?”
* “Fold it—do the sides match?”
* “How many turns until it looks the same?”
* “Where is the line of symmetry?”

---

## Anchors

* **Mirror Symmetry**: Fold-tests, reflection games, bilateral drawing
* **Rotational Symmetry**: Pattern spinning, mandala observation
* **Axis Discovery**: Tracing symmetry lines, balancing figures
* **Tool Use**: Mirrors, spinners, tracing paper

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What makes two sides match?
  - Can a shape look the same if you turn it?
  - How do you find the middle line?
  - Why is symmetry beautiful?

prompts:
  - Finish a shape’s other half by drawing what you think belongs.
  - Spin a flower image—how many times does it look the same?
  - Look in a mirror—what is flipped? What stays the same?
  - Build a pattern that looks the same upside down.
```
