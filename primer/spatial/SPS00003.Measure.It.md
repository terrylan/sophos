## Invocation

> To know a thing’s size is to anchor it in the world. Measuring turns space into language.

---

## Core Narrative

The child learns that space has **scale**. That an object is not just “big” or “small” but **23 centimeters tall**. That a pencil is not just “shorter” than a book, but **by how much**.

With **length, width, and height**, the learner begins to see the world in three measurable axes. The scroll emphasizes **direct manipulation**, using tools like rulers, strings, hands, or non-standard units like blocks.

This scroll prepares the child for **quantitative spatial reasoning**—the hidden backbone of all geometry, physics, and architecture.

## Semantic Anchors

* Measurement as comparison
* Dimension as direction + size
* Units as fixed references
* Space as quantifiable

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “Let’s measure how long this is.”
* “Which is taller, the book or the bottle?”
* “How many blocks tall is this tower?”
* “Width goes side to side, height goes up and down.”

---

## Anchors

* **Dimensions**: Length (forward/back), Width (side to side), Height (up/down)
* **Tools**: Ruler, tape measure, string, hands, informal units (blocks, steps)
* **Skills**: Comparing sizes, estimating, recording measurements

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What’s the tallest object in your room?
  - How do you know which one is longer?
  - Can something be wide but not tall?
  - Why do we use rulers?

prompts:
  - Use blocks or steps to measure five things at home.
  - Estimate the height of your door—then check.
  - Draw a map with objects and their real size labeled.
  - Invent a new unit of measurement and use it.
```
