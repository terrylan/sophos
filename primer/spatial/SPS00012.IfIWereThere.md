## Invocation

> Can you see what I see—if you were where I am?

---

## Core Narrative

This scroll trains the ability to **leave the self** as a spatial anchor and **adopt another point of view**. From swapping seats and predicting what someone else sees, to navigating environments from a map’s perspective, it builds allocentric logic.

This skill is foundational for **3D simulation, navigation, empathy, and collaboration**. It also seeds readiness for higher-level geometric proof, storytelling, and conflict resolution—each requiring decentering of the self.

---

## Semantic Anchors

* Egocentric: “from where I am”
* Allocentric: “from where it is”
* Perspective switching
* Viewer frame vs. world frame

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “If you were standing there, what would you see?”
* “Which way is left for them?”
* “Try to describe it from the bird’s-eye view.”
* “Walk the map in your mind.”

---

## Anchors

* **Perspective Swap Games**: Guess what another person or toy can see from a fixed point
* **Rotated Map Navigation**: Use floor maps oriented differently than the learner
* **Miniature Diorama Simulations**: Describe a scene from multiple camera angles
* **VR or Cardboard Headset Activity**: Compare real and simulated perspectives

## Chunking Map

| Chunk Group           | Elements Included                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Perspective Types** | Egocentric, allocentric, aerial, mirrored, side-on     |
| **Spatial Roleplay**  | Reenactment, puppets, character-based viewing          |
| **Mental Simulation** | Imagining other's view, rotation without movement      |
| **Spatial Empathy**   | Visualizing needs or constraints from different angles |

## Exclusion Zones

* Formal coordinate system math
* Perspective drawing with vanishing points
* Robotics world modeling (future scroll domain)
* Psychological empathy as emotional state (intrapersonal seed)

## Visual Manifest

```json

  "colors": ["directional blue", "map green", "mirror silver"],
  "style": "role-play meets spatial geometry",
  "symbol": "two eyes facing opposite directions connected by a curved arrow over a grid"

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What would you see if you were standing there?
  - Is their left the same as your left?
  - Can you walk the path in your head from that direction?
  - How does it look from above?

prompts:
  - Place a toy and block between you and your friend—can they see it?
  - Turn a map upside down—can you still find the way?
  - Imagine being the bird flying over your playground—what shapes do you see?
  - Pretend to be the bus driver—how do the streets look now?
```
