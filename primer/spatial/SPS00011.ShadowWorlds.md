## Invocation

> What we see is not always what *is*. Sometimes, it is only the *shadow* of being.

---

## Core Narrative

This scroll teaches **indirect spatial awareness**. Rather than manipulating the object directly, learners observe its **shadow**, learning how light, shape, and angle interact.

By drawing shadows, playing with flashlights, and simulating projections, they build the **foundation of spatial inference**—critical for reading diagrams, understanding perspective, and modeling unseen components.

Shadow thinking leads to abstraction, prediction, and **reverse deduction**—bridging to physics, optics, and visual arts.

---

## Semantic Anchors

* Shadow as 2D projection of 3D form
* Perspective as viewing-angle distortion
* Light-source as invisible cause
* Inference as spatial imagination

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “What shape makes this shadow?”
* “Where is the light coming from?”
* “Can you rotate it to match the shadow?”
* “This is not the thing—only its trace.”

---

## Anchors

* **Flashlight Games**: Shining light on toys to cast different shadows
* **Shadow Tracing**: Drawing outlines of shadows at different times
* **Inference Quizzes**: Guessing hidden objects from their cast form
* **Projector Exploration**: Using paper cutouts on overhead projectors or tablets

| Chunk Group               | Elements Included                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Projection Concepts**   | Shadow, silhouette, outline, cast form              |
| **Dimensional Relations** | 3D form → 2D imprint, flattening, hidden faces      |
| **Lighting Mechanics**    | Light direction, occlusion, distortion              |
| **Inferential Thinking**  | Reverse-mapping shape from trace, abstract rotation |

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What makes the shape of a shadow?
  - Can you tell what the object is just by its outline?
  - Where is the light coming from? How do you know?
  - Is the shadow always the same shape as the object?

prompts:
  - Shine a light on a toy and trace its shadow at different angles.
  - Try casting a shadow with your hand that looks like a rabbit or bird.
  - Imagine you're only looking at the shadow—what could it be?
  - Observe how your own shadow changes during the day.
```
