## Invocation

> Space can be counted. Paths can be traced. Every place can be named.

---

## Core Narrative

The child discovers that space can be **gridded**—divided into regular, countable cells. This scroll introduces the idea of **coordinates** as labels for position and movement. The act of stepping from (2,1) to (2,4) becomes a lesson in structure, not just walking.

From story-based maps to number-labeled fields, learners build the foundation of **directional logic**, **symbolic encoding**, and eventually **mathematical graphing**.

Gridwalkers is where play meets pre-algebra.

## Semantic Anchors

* Grid as structured space
* Coordinate as spatial label
* Path as sequence of cells
* Counting as movement logic

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “Start at (0,0), where do you go next?”
* “Move 3 up, 2 right.”
* “Mark the X where the treasure is.”
* “Let’s find the shortest path!”

---

## Anchors

* **Grid Space**: Uniform squares, fields, and map zones
* **Coordinate Pairing**: X (horizontal), Y (vertical) labeling
* **Path Tracing**: Instruction-following and drawing routes
* **Spatial Logic**: Planning routes, avoiding obstacles

| Chunk Group              | Elements Included                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Grid Awareness**       | Recognizing grids in environment and on paper          |
| **Coordinates**          | Learning X before Y, plotting points, axis orientation |
| **Path Movement**        | Executing movement commands, plotting simple routes    |
| **Instruction Building** | Writing and reading movement as steps (up 2, right 3)  |

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What is a grid and how do we use it?
  - How do you describe where something is without pointing?
  - Why does the order (X, Y) matter?
  - Can you trace a path using only numbers?

prompts:
  - Make a treasure map using a 5x5 grid and give directions.
  - Play “coordinate battleship” with a friend.
  - Walk across a chalk grid by following spoken instructions.
  - Try creating a maze that can be solved with a sequence of coordinates.
```
