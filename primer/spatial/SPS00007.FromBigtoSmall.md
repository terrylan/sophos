## Invocation

> Big and small are not things. They are stories told by context.

---

## Core Narrative

“From Big to Small” helps the learner grasp **scale not as an objective fact**, but a relationship. A cat is big to an ant, small to a cow. This scroll grounds that intuition through play: stacking blocks, comparing models, shrinking and enlarging drawings, zooming digital maps, and using rulers or hands for context.

It gently introduces **spatial relativity**: nothing is inherently large or small—it’s all about frames.

---

## Semantic Anchors

* Scale as ratio between sizes
* Proportion as size in relation
* Zooming as changing scope
* Model as representation of whole

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “How big is it compared to…?”
* “Shrink it—does it still look the same?”
* “Let’s draw a big and small version.”
* “This map is small, but it shows something huge.”

---

## Anchors

* **Visual Scale**: Drawing or assembling big and small versions of same form
* **Object Comparison**: Using relative terms (smaller than, half the size)
* **Zoom Abstraction**: Screens, telescopes, or binocular metaphors
* **Scaling Analogies**: Dollhouse\:house, toy car\:real car, map\:territory

| Chunk Group           | Elements Included                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Size Comparison**   | Identifying bigger/smaller in pairs or groups                |
| **Scale Drawing**     | Making tiny or enlarged versions of objects                  |
| **Zoom Imagination**  | Thinking about close-up/far-away versions of the same object |
| **Scale Model Logic** | Using small objects to represent larger ones (or vice versa) |

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What does it mean to say something is small?
  - Can something be big and small at the same time?
  - How can you show something huge using something tiny?
  - When does size matter, and when does it not?

prompts:
  - Compare your hand to your friend’s. Who has the bigger hand? Why?
  - Create a tiny house for a tiny toy. What parts stayed the same?
  - Zoom into a map. What do you see as you go closer?
  - Make a big and small version of a drawing—what changed and what didn’t?
```
