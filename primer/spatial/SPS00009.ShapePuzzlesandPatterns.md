## Invocation

> In repetition, space finds rhythm. Patterns are its first language.

## Core Narrative

This scroll shifts the child’s focus to **repetition as design**. Through tiles, puzzles, and blocks, learners recognize that shapes can **repeat to fill space without gaps or overlaps**—a primitive form of **modular computation**. Tessellations, repeating patterns, and spatial mirroring are encountered as **proto-algorithms** with inputs and outputs across dimensions.

This spatial patterning establishes intuitive logic structures, forming the **bridge between shape recognition and structured thinking**—preparing for algebra, music, code, and architecture.

## Semantic Anchors

* Pattern as repetition rule
* Tessellation as seamless tiling
* Unit block as repeatable module
* Visual loop as spatial logic

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “What comes next in the pattern?”
* “How do these tiles fit perfectly?”
* “Let’s make a snake from triangles.”
* “This puzzle only works if each piece fits without a gap.”

---

## Anchors

* **Tiling Puzzles**: Using square, triangle, hexagon tiles to fill flat space
* **Repeating Units**: Colored beads, blocks, or symbols extended by rule
* **Pattern Coding**: ABAB, AABB, ABCB sequences in shape or color
* **Visual Algorithms**: Repetition with variation (e.g., rotate every third tile)

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What makes a shape pattern complete?
  - Can you spot the mistake in this tile sequence?
  - How do patterns help us organize space?
  - What kind of pattern makes a floor or wall look neat?

prompts:
  - Create your own pattern using just triangles and squares.
  - Make a pattern that changes every third piece.
  - Look for patterns in your house—where are they hiding?
  - What would your own “floor code” look like if you tiled a room?
```
