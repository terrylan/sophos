## Invocation

> Behind every shape is a hidden skeleton of lines and corners. Find the bones of form.

---

## Core Narrative

Every complex form is built from **structural primitives**. This scroll initiates a shift in perspective—from seeing the **whole** to analyzing the **parts**. The line becomes a unit of extension. The edge becomes a boundary. The corner becomes a **pivot of connection**.

By mastering this triad—line, edge, corner—the learner gains the language to **construct**, **deconstruct**, and **analyze**. These are not merely vocabulary terms, but **mental instruments** for spatial investigation.

---

## Semantic Anchors

* Line as extension
* Edge as boundary
* Corner as convergence
* Form as composite of repeatable parts

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “This shape has 3 edges and 3 corners—what is it?”
* “A line can be straight or curved.”
* “The corner is where two edges meet.”
* “How many lines make this shape?”

---

## Anchors

* **Core Elements**: Line (straight, curved), Edge (shape-bounding), Corner (angle vertex)
* **Manipulatives**: Sticks, strings, pipe cleaners, connector nodes
* **Visual Tasks**: Line tracing, corner-counting, structure rebuilding

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What makes a corner a corner?
  - Can you draw a shape with no straight lines?
  - How many lines do you need to build a square?
  - Is a circle made of lines?

prompts:
  - Use sticks and connectors to build every shape you know.
  - Take apart a drawing—circle the lines, corners, and edges.
  - Imagine a shape made only of corners. What would it look like?
  - Describe your room as lines and corners only.
```
