## Invocation

> A map is a memory frozen into code. Learn to read its silence.

---

## Core Narrative

"Map Makers" teaches that maps are **not stories**, but **symbolic tools for space**. Children progress from drawing simple picture-paths to learning **map symbols, legends, and directions**. They explore how abstract marks can represent **real space**‚Äîan encoded second layer over lived geography.

This scroll forges the child's first encounter with **cartographic literacy** and prepares for future domains like **GIS**, **systems modeling**, and **symbolic representation** in science and code.

## Semantic Anchors

* Map as space model
* Symbol as space token
* Key/legend as translation code
* Distance as proportional abstraction

---

## Canonical Phrases

* ‚ÄúThis arrow shows north‚Äîwhy is that important?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs draw your house and everything around it.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhat symbol do we use for a tree?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIf 1 inch equals 10 steps, how far is the store?‚Äù

---

## Anchors

* **Legend Creation**: Making keys for trees, doors, bridges, houses
* **Orientation Logic**: Top of map = North; left = West, etc.
* **Proportional Distance**: Using fingers, steps, rulers to encode scale
* **Route Mapping**: Drawing simple paths with landmarks

## Chunking Map

| Chunk Group           | Elements Included                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symbol Literacy**   | Tree = üå≥, River = \~\~\~, House = ‚òê, Person = üî∏, etc.             |
| **Key + Legend Use**  | Making and reading map keys and matching to map features            |
| **Orientation Work**  | Top-down map views, cardinal directions, using a compass arrow      |
| **Distance Encoding** | Measuring paths and translating into map scale (‚Äú1 inch = 5 steps‚Äù) |

## Exclusion Zones

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What is a map and how is it different from a story?
  - Why do maps need a key or legend?
  - How can you show something big using a small map?
  - What does ‚Äúnorth‚Äù mean on a map?

prompts:
  - Draw a map of your bedroom. What symbols will you use?
  - Use a ruler to make a map of your walk to school.
  - Make a treasure map and give someone else your legend to find the prize.
  - Look at a map and tell a story based on its symbols.
```
