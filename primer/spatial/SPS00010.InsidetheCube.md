## Invocation

> What is inside the box is not just space—it’s structure.

---

## Core Narrative

This scroll takes the learner **into** objects. No longer is form only about the **outside boundary**—it is about **enclosure, shape, and containment** in three dimensions. Using cubes, pyramids, and cylinders, learners develop vocabulary and mental manipulation skills around **faces**, **edges**, and **vertices**.

It establishes the mind's ability to “turn the shape around inside,” forming a bridge toward **mental modeling**—core for engineering, physics, programming, and design logic.

---

## Semantic Anchors

* Volume as interior space
* Edge as boundary between faces
* Vertex as corner of convergence
* Faces as visible 2D boundaries of 3D forms

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “How many faces does this cube have?”
* “Let’s fold this net into a box.”
* “What shape is the shadow of this cube?”
* “Can you rotate it in your mind?”

---

## Anchors

* **Object Deconstruction**: Pulling apart boxes, dice, or blocks to name parts
* **3D Nets**: Paper templates folded into cubes, pyramids, prisms
* **Physical Assembly**: Using blocks to build from multiple viewpoints
* **Visual Manipulation**: Imagining rotation, stacking, and hollowing

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - How many faces and corners does a cube have?
  - What happens if you rotate a shape in your head?
  - Can you fold this into a cube? What parts touch?
  - What does “inside” really mean in geometry?

prompts:
  - Find objects at home that are shaped like a cube, sphere, or pyramid.
  - Draw a box and label its edges and corners.
  - Try building a shape from memory using blocks.
  - Fold a paper net into a 3D shape—what shape will it make?
```
