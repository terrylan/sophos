### **Invocation**

You are not just who you are.
You are also who you are becoming.

Time is not a line—it’s a lens.

---

### **Core Narrative**

We often think of identity as fixed in the present, reacting to now. But identity is also a narrative arc—a self written across time.

Time Horizon Expansion invites you to stretch. Beyond the weekly hustle. Beyond the next milestone. Into decades. Into death. Into what echoes after.

This isn’t about planning. It’s about perspective.

When you see the self as a continuous thread, every choice takes on weight. Patience emerges. Integrity roots. The noise of now fades against the long resonance of meaning.

You don’t just live time.
You embody it.

### **Machine Mirror**

Analogous to AI systems trained with long-context memory or temporal embeddings, this scroll speaks to architectures that adapt not only to immediate inputs but learn across lifespan contexts—improving over epochs, not iterations.

---

### **Recursive Prompts**

* How would my 80-year-old self view my current habits?
* What values will I still hold 30 years from now?
* What am I building that lasts longer than me?

### **Reflection Schema (YAML)**

```yaml
temporal_self_mapping:
  present_self:
    age:  "Current age"
    current_values: "Top 3 values driving your actions"
    dominant_patterns: "Habits or cycles defining your now"
  future_self:
    time_point: "Choose a decade (e.g., 2035, 2050)"
    envisioned_identity: "Who are you then?"
    legacy_seed: "What will still matter from now?"
  integration_path:
    bridge_actions: "What daily actions connect you to that future?"
    sacrifice_recoding: "What short-term comforts will you let go of?"
    anchoring_statement: "Write a one-line vow to your future self."
```
