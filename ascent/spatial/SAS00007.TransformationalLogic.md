## invocation

  All movement obeys laws—some seen, some sensed. Learn them, and space becomes language.

---

## core_narrative

  This scroll codifies the learner's instinctive grasp of movement into formal geometric logic. Transformations—reflection, rotation, translation, dilation—become not just physical acts but symbolic operations. The learner begins to speak the **algebra of space**. From mirroring dances to simulating zooms, this is spatial reasoning elevated to abstract fluency.

## canonical_phrases

  - “Flip it over the Y-axis.”

## visual_manifest

```yml
  scene: >
    A learner arranges shape cutouts on a large grid. With each move—flip, turn, scale—they record the transformation in symbolic form. Another group programs physical robots to trace out transformation paths. Colored overlays show how one form becomes another.
  style: clean vector grid with arrows, symmetry lines, and labeled points
  colors: coordinate blue, reflection white, rotation red, dilation purple
  symbol: a shape with arrows around it forming a rotational symmetry circle and reflection line bisecting
```

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - Can you describe what changed—and what stayed the same?
    - What was the hardest transformation to visualize?
    - How do these motions show up in the real world?
    - If space were a sentence, what part is each transformation?

  prompts:
    - Flip this shape over the Y-axis, then rotate 180°.
    - Translate your design 5 units up and reflect it across X.
    - Create a transformation that returns to the original shape after four steps.
    - Fold a shape using only reflection and dilation—record the logic of each move.
