>  What if the pattern repeats inside itself… forever?

## core_narrative

This scroll moves beyond basic symmetry into **recursive symmetry**, unveiling fractals, dynamic tiling, and scale-invariant designs. Where previous scrolls taught “same on both sides,” here the learner explores how shapes *transform into themselves*. The idea of *symmetry through motion* introduces them to deeper visual math, natural complexity, and design aesthetics beyond Euclidean simplicity.

## semantic_anchors

* recursive symmetry
* fractals and self-similarity
* dynamic tiling
* infinite nesting
* pattern emergence

## canonical_phrases

* “Smaller and smaller, but still the same.”
* “Each part holds the whole.”
* “Pattern in motion is symmetry evolving.”
* “Tiling without gaps or overlaps.”

---

## anchors

* **Fractal coloring**: Color-code iterative branches or spirals by depth level
* **Mandelbrot zoom**: Watch and sketch fractals that repeat deeper and deeper
* **Tile generator**: Use cut shapes to tessellate without gaps
* **Dynamic symmetry walks**: Physical dance mimicking recursive moves (e.g., arms mirror arms)

## chunking_map

* recursion steps: seed → first replicate → deep iterate
* symmetry types: reflection, rotational, translational, recursive
* fractal concepts: self-similarity, iteration, limit
* tiling patterns: hexagonal, triangle, Penrose, L-system based

## exclusion_zones

* mathematical proof of fractal dimensions
* infinite recursion formalism
* chaotic attractor visualization
* recursive programming (held for logic scrolls)

## visual_manifest

```yml
  scene: 
  >    A series of branching trees drawn on a tablet, each smaller than the last, forming a recursive spiral. In the background, a child arranges triangle tiles into a dragon curve on the floor. The ambient screen shows zoom-ins of a Mandelbrot fractal morphing infinitely.
  style: recursive line art + tile overlays
  colors: midnight violet, emerald green, recursive gold
  symbol: triple-spiral triangle tessellating into itself
```

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - How is this shape repeating into itself?
    - What happens if we zoom deeper and deeper?
    - Where does the pattern begin—or does it?
    - Can you find the same shape at a different scale?

  prompts:
    - Create a pattern where each part looks like the whole.
    - Imagine tiling a floor forever—what shapes would you use?
    - How would a mountain range be fractal?
    - Design a flower with infinite recursive petals.
