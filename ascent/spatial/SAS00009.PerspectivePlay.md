## invocation

  The world looks different depending on where you stand. What if you could see from every place at once?

---

## core_narrative

  This scroll trains the **plasticity of viewpoint**—how perspective bends space, defines scale, and alters reality. It builds an understanding of spatial relativity through vanishing points, horizon lines, and frame shifts. From drawing cities to imagining others’ visual access, learners develop **observer-fluid cognition**.

## semantic_anchors

  - spatial perspective
  - vanishing point theory
  - distortion as information
  - relative positioning
  - viewpoint transformation

## canonical_phrases

  - “Where you stand shapes what you see.”
  - “A straight line might curve if your lens bends.”
  - “Perspective isn’t wrong—it’s where you’re looking from.”
  - “Step into their shoes, and the world reshapes.”

## anchors

  - **Perspective drawing**: 1-point, 2-point, and 3-point systems
  - **Distortion games**: use of convex mirrors and fish-eye effects
  - **Role-play switching**: who sees what from where?
  - **Virtual walkarounds**: camera shifts in modeled scenes

## visual_manifest

```yml
  scene: >
    A street scene drawn in multiple perspectives, with one side in 1-point, another in 2-point, and an overhead fish-eye distortion. Children walk through it wearing glasses that simulate warped fields, narrating what they see from shifting heights and corners.
  style: hand-drawn overlays with shifting gridlines
  colors: deep blue (truth), orange (distortion), soft graphite
  symbol: a shifting triangle eye with mirrored vanishing lines
```

## agent_schema

```yml
  agent_name: Vanish
  abilities:
    - Generate and explain perspective drawings
    - Shift observer reference dynamically
    - Create scenes from multiple viewpoints
  learning_goals:
    - Build intuition for spatial distortion
    - Switch perspectives and explain outcomes
    - Apply viewpoint logic to empathy and modeling
  future_extensions:
    - 3D multi-agent simulation environments
    - spatial empathy training for VR
    - AI camera modeling for narrative games
```
---

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - What changes when you move your eye?
    - Can two people see the same thing differently?
    - How does distortion help us understand depth?
    - What happens to the world when your frame shifts?

  prompts:
    - Draw the same object from three different angles.
    - Write a scene told from multiple spatial perspectives.
    - Explain why train tracks “touch” on the horizon.
    - Role-play being an ant, a bird, and a human in the same space.
