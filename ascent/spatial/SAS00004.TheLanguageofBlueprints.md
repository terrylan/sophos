## invocation

  Every structure starts as a drawing that speaks without words.

## core_narrative

  This scroll initiates the learner into the **symbolic language of space**—a literacy distinct from verbal language. Blueprints, plans, and schematics compress 3D reality into coded 2D. Through this, one learns how *precision*, *scale*, and *angle* replace storytelling in spatial design. This is where geometry meets engineering, and where vision becomes instruction.

## semantic_anchors

 * orthographic views
 * spatial representation
 * scale and proportion in drawing
 * symbolic compression
 * diagrammatic reasoning

---

## canonical_phrases

 * “What does this view show?”
 * “Draw it from above, then the side.”
 * “How big is that, really?”
 * “A picture that builds something.”

---

## anchors

 * **Viewpoint drills**: Draw objects from top, side, and front, then verify
 * **Scale translation**: Measure a model and scale it down to draw precisely
 * **Symbol decoding**: Learn blueprint symbols for doors, walls, circuits, etc.
 * **Blueprint relay**: Interpret and follow peer-drawn plans to build

## chunking_map

 * 3-view system: top, front, side
 * projection logic: real object → flat views
 * scale logic: real size ↔ reduced representation
 * schematic grammar: icons, lines, notations

---

## exclusion_zones

 * 3D rendering or animation
 * architectural software
 * full construction plans (reserved for Master tier)
 * electrical/mechanical circuit theory

## visual_manifest

```yml
  scene:
  >  A table is split in two halves. On one side: a child draws clean top/side/front diagrams of a model house. On the other: a peer tries to reconstruct the model from the blueprint alone. Between them, a ruler, compass, and stencil lie like sacred instruments.
  style: precise ink line art with geometric overlays
  colors: technical graphite, cobalt blueprint, measurement gold
  symbol: a cube unfurled into 3 orthographic views, pinned by compass needles
```

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - Can you build from what you drew?
    - What does this shape look like from above?
    - Why is this symbol used instead of a full drawing?
    - How can a flat drawing contain so much information?

  prompts:
    - Draw the same object from three different views.
    - Use a 1:10 scale to design your own mini structure.
    - Follow a friend’s blueprint without seeing the object.
    - Invent symbols for parts of a machine—can others follow it?
```
