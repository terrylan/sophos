## invocation

  What if you could fold time like paper? What if space could loop? The fourth dimension beckons.

---

## core_narrative

  This scroll tempts the learner into **hyperspatial imagination**. It does not teach 4D geometry formally—it awakens *intuitive pathways* for understanding it. Through stories, looping puzzles, and metaphors, learners begin to imagine tesseracts rotating, dimensions intersecting, and time behaving like space. The scroll becomes a portal to **spatial-temporal cognition**.

## semantic_anchors

  - four-dimensional geometry
  - temporal-spatial mapping
  - recursion in space
  - hyperdimensional rotation
  - space-time abstraction

---

## canonical_phrases

  - “This is the shadow of a higher thing.”
  - “You walked forward… and ended up behind yourself.”
  - “Every moment is a coordinate in the fourth axis.”
  - “You’re not stuck—you’re looped.”

---

## anchors

  - **Tesseract models**: Use 3D projections and animated transitions
  - **Time-loop puzzles**: Game-like mechanics where cause and effect wrap
  - **Story recursion**: Narratives with folded timelines and mirrored endings
  - **Meta-maps**: Maps of spaces that change based on time or interaction

## visual_manifest

```yml
  scene: >
    A translucent tesseract rotates gently, casting shifting shadows into three-space. Nearby, a game board loops back onto itself with hidden doors reappearing from behind. A child explains how they “went into the cube and came out on top” by folding space in their story.
  style: high-contrast wireframes with ghosted overlays
  colors: deep violet, silver-gray, recursion gold
  symbol: a rotating tesseract with mirrored trails and circular arrows fading into time spirals
```

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - What part of the tesseract surprised you most?
    - Can you imagine how your story loops back to its beginning?
    - What happens when space bends into itself?
    - How can time be a shape?

  prompts:
    - Sketch a cube’s shadow, then a tesseract’s shadow.
    - Write a story where walking in a straight line brings you back.
    - Design a space that loops based on actions, not position.
    - Build a map where time is the fourth coordinate.
