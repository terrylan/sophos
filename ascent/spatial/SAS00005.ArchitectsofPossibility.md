## invocation

  Imagination becomes reality only when it respects the rules of space.

---

## core_narrative

  This scroll activates the **creative-yet-constrained spatial designer**. Learners begin to design—intentionally. They must work within limits: material constraints, movement logic, object interactions. From building mazes, rooms, or fictional cities, they move from aesthetic stacking to meaningful construction. This is where imagination earns its architecture.

## semantic_anchors

  - constrained design
  - spatial logic under rules
  - systems thinking
  - function-guided creativity

## canonical_phrases

  - “What is this for?”
  - “Does it work within the space?”
  - “Could someone use it?”
  - “Design with both form and rule.”

---

## anchors

  - **Constraint cards**: Limit number of pieces, shapes, or rules for each build
  - **Purpose-first tasks**: Design a shelter, path, or machine with stated goals
  - **Modular zones**: Define repeated units (e.g., same-sized tiles or rooms)
  - **Failure redesign**: If a system breaks or jams, fix it without removing the constraints

## visual_manifest

```yml
  scene: >
    A table full of building blocks, but each group of learners has a unique set of constraints—some get only arches, others only cubes or rods. One team designs a compact village with only 10 tiles. Another makes a bridge that must hold a marble. Rules are posted like architectural codes.
  style: conceptual sketch with labels and grid overlays
  colors: constraint red, modular gray, intent yellow
  symbol: a triangle inscribed in a square grid, surrounded by concentric design rules

```yml
  agent_name: Modulith
  abilities:
    - Enforce spatial design constraints
    - Suggest optimization paths
    - Rate intent-alignment of designs
  learning_goals:
    - Design within spatial limitations
    - Construct modular and functional systems
    - Develop aesthetic judgement rooted in utility
  future_extensions:
    - generative architecture co-design
    - constraint-driven AI learning environments
    - logic-crafting for spatial simulations
```

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - What made your design work?
    - Where did you struggle with the rules?
    - How would you improve it—within the same limits?
    - What makes something functional, not just beautiful?

  prompts:
    - Build a structure using only 12 identical pieces.
    - Design a living space that fits within a 3x3 grid.
    - Make a system where every piece connects to two others.
    - Take your failed design and rebuild it under the same rules—but better.
```
