## invocation 

>  Close your eyes. Turn the shape. Now—where did the corner go?

---

## core_narrative

>  This scroll builds the foundation of **mental rotation**, a crucial sub-skill of spatial intelligence. Learners move beyond physical turning to mentally simulate rotations of 2D and 3D shapes. This mental muscle is vital for geometry, physics, advanced navigation, and design logic. Without it, learners remain grounded in only static forms.

## semantic_anchors

*  mental rotation
*  angle tracking
*  object constancy through transformation
*  visual-spatial simulation
*  rotation vs. reflection

---

## canonical_phrases

*  “Rotate it in your mind.”
*  “What does it look like turned 90°?”
*  “Pretend you’re spinning it in space.”
*  “Where will the red side end up?”

---

## anchors

*  **Tactile-to-mental bridge**: Use rotating blocks first, then remove them and use imagination
*  **Rotation challenge cards**: Match rotated versions of the same object
*  **2D/3D dual puzzles**: Flat shape to folded cube, and vice versa
*  **Mental spin games**: Narrated shape-turning tasks done with eyes closed

## chunking_map

* rotation angles: 90°, 180°, 270°, 360°
* shape types: 2D polygons, 3D solids
* view transitions: top → front, front → side
* frame of rotation: centered, edge-pinned, axis-shifted

## exclusion_zones

* full geometric proofs
* complex rotation matrices
* animation programming
* physical torque/forces (reserved for physics)

## visual_manifest

```yml

  scene:  A learner sits with a foldable cube net on paper, visualizing how it folds. Floating above, a transparent wireframe cube spins slowly, each face labeled with colors and letters. Their finger traces air rotations while their eyes stay closed.
  style: minimal wireframe + dynamic morph overlay
  colors: slate blue, transparent white, rotation-orange
  symbol: three-axis gyroscope overlaid on a polygon mesh
```

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - What does this shape look like if turned 90°?
    - Can you rotate it in your head without moving?
    - Where will the green side face after a full turn?
    - What’s the difference between flipping and rotating?

  prompts:
    - Imagine a cube spinning in space—where will the top go?
    - Try folding this shape in your mind—what solid does it make?
    - Describe how the object looks from above, now from the left.
    - Spin the figure 180° and draw what you imagine.
