## invocation

  Every maze hides a mechanism; every mechanism builds a world.

---

## core_narrative

  This scroll evolves the learner from a navigator to a **spatial systems thinker**. Mazes are not just challenges of left or right—they are logic encoded in form. Mechanisms within space—gates, triggers, traps—demand causal anticipation. Learners don't just move through space; they reshape it, program it, and understand that spatial design can *think back*.

## semantic_anchors

  - spatial causality
  - logic-infused environment
  - maze design and traversal
  - interactive spatial systems
  - conditional spatial logic

---

## canonical_phrases

  - “What happens if I go there?”
  - “This door only opens when that lever moves.”
  - “The map shows more than paths—it shows rules.”
  - “Build space that responds.”

---

## anchors

  - **Maze creation**: Draw or build mazes with dead ends, loops, and logic paths
  - **Trigger mechanics**: Add spatial rules (e.g., step on X to open Y)
  - **Multi-level puzzles**: Include hidden zones, elevation, or perspective tricks
  - **Mechanism puzzles**: Design chain-reaction systems from spatial placement

## visual_manifest

```yml
  scene: >
    A group of learners builds a tabletop maze with blocks. Some sections include trapdoors (activated by marbles), rotating gates, or mirror redirection. Another group solves a scroll-map that reveals paths only after solving riddles.
  style: intricate linework over blueprint-style overlays
  colors: mechanism bronze, logic silver, path blue
  symbol: a maze overlaid with gears, levers, and arrows in causal flow

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - Did your mechanism do what you expected?
    - How did the space change based on your actions?
    - What was hidden—and why?
    - Can you think of a real building or machine that works like your design?

  prompts:
    - Build a maze that requires solving a puzzle to escape.
    - Add a switch or lever that changes the space.
    - Draw a map that has secrets—unseen on first glance.
    - Create a chain-reaction machine using dominoes, ramps, and triggers.
