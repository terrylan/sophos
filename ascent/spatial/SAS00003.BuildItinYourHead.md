## invocation

  Can you see it in your mind before you build it with your hands?

---

## core_narrative

  This scroll elevates spatial cognition by cultivating **3D internal modeling**. Where earlier scrolls focused on recognizing and rotating shapes, this stage trains the learner to build—internally. Through scaffold-free mental assembly, they gain capacity to visualize structures from parts, to simulate mechanics without diagrams, and to manifest spatial concepts into design. This faculty lies at the heart of architects, surgeons, engineers, and physicists.

## canonical_phrases

* “Can you build it in your head?”
* “Stack it in space—don’t draw it yet.”
* “What connects to what—mentally?”
* “No tools, just your mind’s eye.”

## anchors

* **Mind-only builds**: Verbal instruction of complex shape, mentally constructed before revealing
* **Blindfold blueprints**: Describe an object seen briefly, then mentally reconstruct from memory
* **Voxel visualization**: Think in blocks or layers to imagine shape growth
* **Mental walkarounds**: Navigate an object from imagined different views

## visual_manifest

```yml
  scene: 
  >  A learner sits calmly, eyes closed. In their imagination, blocks rise and snap into place, forming a complex staircase tower with internal tunnels and bridges. Floating line-drawings animate step-by-step constructions in their mind’s eye.
  style: transparent isometric + ghost structures
  colors: blueprint teal, mindspace gray, kinetic amber
  symbol: a hollow cube layered with floating internal structures
```

## reflection_schema

```yml
  questions:
    - Can you describe the object you imagined?
    - What connects where—and why?
    - How many levels are there in your mental structure?
    - Could you rebuild it exactly as you imagined?

  prompts:
    - Without drawing, construct a tower of 3 types of blocks.
    - Imagine a room with hidden rooms inside it—what does it look like?
    - Mentally assemble a bicycle—where do you start?
    - Rotate the object and imagine what’s behind it.
