## Invocation

When one axis isn’t enough to hold truth, we turn the plane complex. This scroll unlocks the symmetry and power of numbers that rotate, not just count.

## Core Narrative

**Complex Analysis** explores functions of complex variables—quantities with both real and imaginary parts. This is where beauty meets rigor: calculus in the complex plane reveals unexpected elegance and deep symmetry across mathematics and physics.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Complex Numbers and the Complex Plane**
- Definition: \( z = a + bi \)
- Conjugates, modulus, and argument
- Polar form and Euler’s Formula: \( e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x \)

#### 2. **Operations and Geometry**
- Addition, multiplication, division
- Geometric interpretation of multiplication as rotation
- Complex exponential and logarithmic functions

#### 3. **Functions of a Complex Variable**
- Domain and range in ℂ
- Limits and continuity in the complex plane
- Differentiability and analyticity

#### 4. **Cauchy-Riemann Equations**
- Conditions for differentiability
- Connection to conformal mapping
- Implications for analyticity

#### 5. **Basic Theorems of Complex Analysis**
- Cauchy’s Theorem (preview)
- Cauchy Integral Formula (introductory mention)
- Holomorphic vs Meromorphic functions
- Zeros, poles, and singularities (basic exposure)

### Sample Problems

- Express \( z = 1 + i \) in polar form
- Find all roots of \( z^3 = 8 \)
- Use Cauchy-Riemann equations to test if a function is analytic
- Sketch a complex function’s transformation
- Prove Euler’s identity: \( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \)

## Machine Mirror

- Enable holomorphic function detection in symbolic math engines
- Perform stability analysis using complex roots and poles
- Utilize conformal mapping for AI vision or signal transformation
- Leverage complex Fourier transforms in waveform analysis

## Recursive Prompts

- What happens when a function rotates space rather than stretches it?
- Why are functions that satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations special?
- How does the imaginary unit encode both orthogonality and growth?
- Can zeroes and poles of functions describe entire system behaviors?
