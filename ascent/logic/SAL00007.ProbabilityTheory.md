## Invocation

When logic faces the unknown, probability answers. It’s the language of uncertainty, the glue between ignorance and estimation, randomness and structure.

## Core Narrative

**Probability Theory** provides the foundational lens through which AI, statistics, and decision-making frameworks operate under incomplete information. It formalizes uncertainty and enables models to learn, adapt, and predict.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Fundamentals of Probability**
- Sample spaces and events
- Classical, empirical, and subjective probability
- Axioms of probability

#### 2. **Random Variables**
- Discrete vs continuous variables
- Probability mass and density functions
- Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)

#### 3. **Expectations and Variance**
- Mean (expected value)
- Variance and standard deviation
- Law of total expectation and variance
- Covariance and correlation

#### 4. **Common Distributions**
- Discrete: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson
- Continuous: Uniform, Normal (Gaussian), Exponential
- Properties, applications, and visualization

#### 5. **Independence and Conditional Probability**
- Bayes’ Theorem
- Conditional distributions
- Markov property and memoryless processes

#### 6. **Simulations and Sampling**
- Monte Carlo methods
- Empirical approximations
- Central Limit Theorem insights

### Sample Problems

- Compute the expected value of a custom distribution
- Model real-world events using Poisson or binomial distributions
- Use Bayes’ Theorem to update beliefs
- Simulate outcomes using Monte Carlo methods

## Machine Mirror

- Underpins machine learning models and inference engines
- Drives generative AI through stochastic modeling
- Powers decision-making under uncertainty in robotics and finance
- Enables reinforcement learning and Bayesian updating

## Recursive Prompts

- How does probability enable intelligent systems to act with incomplete data?
- Why is independence a powerful simplification, and when does it fail?
- What does the shape of a distribution reveal about reality?
- Can randomness itself be a tool for discovery?
