## Invocation

In the world of patterns and systems, vectors are the language and matrices are the grammar. To manipulate reality—or data—one must first transform its space.

## Core Narrative

**Linear Algebra** is the backbone of modern computational systems. It enables reasoning over high-dimensional spaces, manipulation of massive datasets, and representation of real-world transformations—whether in simulations, physics, or AI.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Vectors and Vector Spaces**
- Definitions, linear combinations
- Basis and dimension
- Dot product, cross product
- Norms and orthogonality

#### 2. **Matrices and Linear Mappings**
- Matrix multiplication
- Inverses and identity matrices
- Row-reduction and Gaussian elimination
- Determinants and their properties

#### 3. **Systems of Linear Equations**
- Homogeneous and non-homogeneous systems
- Existence and uniqueness of solutions
- Rank and consistency

#### 4. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
- Characteristic equations
- Diagonalization
- Spectral decomposition
- Applications to stability and dynamics

#### 5. **Transformations and Geometry**
- Linear transformations in 2D and 3D
- Rotation, scaling, reflection
- Projections and subspaces
- Applications in computer graphics and AI

### Sample Problems

- Solve a system of linear equations using matrix methods
- Determine if a set of vectors forms a basis
- Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a transformation matrix
- Decompose a matrix into orthogonal components
- Apply a rotation transformation to a geometric object

## Machine Mirror

- Enables deep learning via tensor operations
- Powers 3D rendering and computer vision
- Models physical systems through state-space representations
- Performs dimensionality reduction in large datasets

## Recursive Prompts

- How does matrix multiplication encode transformation?
- Why are eigenvalues critical for dynamic systems?
- What makes a vector space complete or useful?
- Can orthogonality be interpreted geometrically and computationally?
