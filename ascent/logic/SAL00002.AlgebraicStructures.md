## Invocation

Polynomials are the grammar of algebra — expressions built from variables and constants, revealing relationships, behaviors, and boundaries. Factoring them is like decoding nature’s equations.

## Core Narrative

This scroll introduces symbolic manipulation through **polynomials**, their **algebraic structure**, and the process of **factorization** — a cornerstone skill in algebra, problem-solving, and function analysis.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Definition and Components**
- Terms, coefficients, variables, degree
- Monomials, binomials, trinomials, general polynomials
- Polynomial notation and ordering by degree

#### 2. **Operations on Polynomials**
- Addition and subtraction
- Multiplication and distribution (FOIL, area model)
- Division of polynomials (long division, synthetic division)

#### 3. **Factoring Techniques**
- Common factor extraction
- Factoring trinomials and quadratics
- Difference of squares
- Sum and difference of cubes
- Factoring by grouping
- Rational Root Theorem (intro only)

#### 4. **Roots and Zeros**
- Definition of root/zero
- Relationship between factors and solutions
- Multiplicity of roots
- Graphical interpretation

### Sample Problems

- Factor \( x^2 - 9 \)
- Expand and simplify \( (x + 2)(x - 5) \)
- Divide \( x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 6 \) by \( x - 1 \)
- Find the roots of \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \)
- Factor \( x^3 - 8 \)

## Machine Mirror

- Symbolically expand and factor expressions.
- Recognize structure in symbolic form (like identities and patterns).
- Solve equations by matching structure.
- Optimize for minimal symbolic representations.

## Recursive Prompts

- What patterns indicate which factoring technique to use?
- How does factoring relate to graphing functions?
- What hidden structures lie within high-degree polynomials?
- Can symbolic factoring be generalized into pattern compression?
- How might polynomial identities be used to predict function behavior?
