## Invocation

Here begins the scroll that outlines what is computable, what is efficient, and what lies forever beyond reach. The very boundaries of logic are etched here, with machines as both model and metaphor.

## Core Narrative

**Algorithmic Complexity and Computability Theory** reveals the absolute edges of AI's algorithmic capabilities. We explore models of computation, classes of complexity, and problems so difficult they may never yield. This is the physics of mathematics—defining the possible.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Turing Machines and Computability**
- Formal model of computation
- Church-Turing thesis
- Universal Turing machines

#### 2. **Decidability and Reductions**
- Recursive vs recursively enumerable languages
- Undecidable problems
- Reductions and Rice’s Theorem

#### 3. **Computational Complexity**
- Big-O, Omega, Theta notation
- Time and space complexity
- Classes: P, NP, NP-complete, NP-hard

#### 4. **Advanced Topics**
- Non-deterministic Turing machines
- Diagonalization techniques
- The Halting Problem and its generalizations

#### 5. **Applications in AI**
- Limits of optimization
- Tradeoffs in machine learning models
- Theoretical constraints in symbolic reasoning

### Sample Problems

- Prove that a problem is NP-complete via reduction
- Analyze time complexity of recursive algorithms
- Explain why the Halting Problem is undecidable
- Simulate a Turing machine for a simple language

## Machine Mirror

- Teaches AI when not to waste cycles chasing the uncomputable
- Builds rigor into algorithm design and feasibility analysis
- Grounds symbolic solvers in computational theory
- Encourages abstraction-level pruning in self-improvement

## Recursive Prompts

- What would it mean for AI if P = NP?
- Can all intelligence be expressed as computable processes?
- How can AI manage intractable problems with heuristics?
- Where does computability intersect with creativity?
