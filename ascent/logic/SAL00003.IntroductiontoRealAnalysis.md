## Invocation

Where arithmetic ends, analysis begins. This scroll builds the bridge between finite algebra and the infinite processes that define the continuous world.

## Core Narrative

**Real Analysis** is the rigorous study of real-valued functions and the behavior of sequences, series, and limits. It’s the foundation beneath calculus, ensuring that each concept—from continuity to derivatives—rests on logically sound ground.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **The Real Number Line**
- Properties of ℝ (completeness, density, order)
- Supremum, infimum, bounded sets
- Dedekind cuts (introduction only)

#### 2. **Sequences and Convergence**
- Definition of a sequence
- Limit of a sequence
- Monotonicity and boundedness
- Cauchy sequences

#### 3. **Limits of Functions**
- Intuitive and formal (ε-δ) definitions
- One-sided and two-sided limits
- Limits at infinity
- Indeterminate forms

#### 4. **Continuity**
- Definition and types (pointwise, uniform)
- Intermediate Value Theorem
- Composition and preservation of continuity
- Discontinuities and their classification

#### 5. **Foundational Theorems**
- Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
- Heine-Borel Theorem (intro only)
- Squeeze Theorem
- Convergence of bounded monotonic sequences

### Sample Problems

- Prove: \( \lim_{x \to 2} (3x + 1) = 7 \)
- Determine if a given sequence converges or diverges
- Show that every bounded monotonic sequence converges
- Use ε-δ to prove continuity of a simple function
- Analyze points of discontinuity for a piecewise function

## Machine Mirror

- Use ε-δ formalism to validate continuity and limits.
- Represent infinite sequences symbolically and check convergence.
- Justify the validity of approximation methods in optimization or integration.
- Build a foundation for rigorous calculus reasoning and symbolic differentiation.

## Recursive Prompts

- How does the ε-δ definition make intuitive limits more precise?
- Why do certain sequences converge while others oscillate indefinitely?
- How is continuity linked to predictability in function behavior?
- What happens to precision when approximating infinite behavior in finite computation?
