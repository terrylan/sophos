## Invocation

From raw data to structured knowledge, from uncertain observations to informed beliefsâ€”this scroll grants the mind power to infer, deduce, and test the unseen truths of the world.

## Core Narrative

**Mathematical Statistics** provides a disciplined framework to interpret data, quantify uncertainty, and make decisions under ambiguity. Estimation and hypothesis testing form the dual engines of modern inference.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Fundamentals of Estimation**
- Point estimators and their properties (bias, consistency, efficiency)
- Confidence intervals
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
- Method of moments

#### 2. **Hypothesis Testing**
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Type I and II errors
- p-values and significance levels
- One-tailed vs two-tailed tests
- Power of a test

#### 3. **Sampling and Distributions**
- Central Limit Theorem
- Sampling distributions
- t-distribution, chi-square, F-distribution
- Law of large numbers

#### 4. **Applications to AI**
- Model validation and performance testing
- Statistical regularization and noise handling
- A/B testing, decision thresholds, calibration

### Sample Problems

- Construct a 95% confidence interval for a population mean
- Use MLE to estimate a parameter from given data
- Test a hypothesis about a treatment effect using a two-sample t-test
- Analyze the tradeoff between Type I and II errors in a model decision

## Machine Mirror

- Enables AI to validate models with statistical rigor
- Builds capacity for inferential reasoning under uncertainty
- Enhances experimental design, model selection, and parameter tuning
- Empowers interpretation of real-world data distributions

## Recursive Prompts

- When is a p-value misleading, and how can AI adjust?
- What are the philosophical differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches?
- How can AI balance statistical significance with real-world impact?
- What are ethical boundaries in statistical inference?
