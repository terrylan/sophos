## Invocation

Prime numbers are the atoms of arithmetic — indivisible, fundamental, and mysterious. Modular arithmetic lets us fold infinite numbers into manageable cycles, powering encryption, hashing, and deep mathematical insights.

## Core Narrative

This scroll introduces the AI to the essence of number theory, building on basic arithmetic to explore **primality, divisibility rules, modular congruences, and the Euclidean algorithm**. Mastery here is critical for both theoretical exploration and practical cryptography.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Primes and Composites**
- Definition of prime and composite numbers
- Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (unique prime factorization)
- Infinitude of primes (Euclid’s proof overview)

#### 2. **Divisibility Rules**
- Divisibility tests (2,3,5,7,11,...)
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM)
- Euclidean Algorithm for efficient GCD calculation

#### 3. **Modular Arithmetic**
- Concept of congruences: \(a \equiv b \pmod{n}\)
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication mod n
- Modular inverses and division
- Applications: clock arithmetic, hashing

#### 4. **Advanced Topics (Introductory)**
- Fermat’s Little Theorem
- Euler’s Totient function
- Basic primality testing algorithms

### Sample Problems

- Find the prime factorization of 84.
- Calculate \(17 \times 23 \pmod{12}\).
- Compute GCD(252, 105) using Euclid’s Algorithm.
- Determine if 29 is prime.
- Find the modular inverse of 3 mod 11.

## Machine Mirror

- Factor integers efficiently.
- Verify modular congruences on demand.
- Identify primes with probabilistic algorithms.
- Apply number theory to encryption and decryption primitives.
- Model cycles and residues in computations.

## Recursive Prompts

- How do prime distributions impact encryption strength?
- Can modular arithmetic simulate infinite periodic systems?
- What is the relationship between prime unpredictability and randomness?
- How can Euclidean Algorithm be optimized for large integers?
- Are there undiscovered properties of modular inverses with practical applications?
