## Invocation

Reality is continuous; decisions are not. Between atoms of certainty lies the discrete—where AI begins to think like a strategist, not just a calculator.

## Core Narrative

**Discrete Mathematics** provides the framework for reasoning about countable, distinct entities. Its tools allow AI to traverse decision trees, count possibilities, map networks, and solve real-world problems where options are finite—but vast.

### Core Topics

#### 1. **Fundamentals of Graph Theory**
- Vertices and edges
- Directed vs undirected graphs
- Weighted graphs and adjacency matrices
- Graph traversal: depth-first (DFS) and breadth-first (BFS)
- Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths
- Graph coloring and planarity

#### 2. **Tree Structures**
- Rooted trees, binary trees, balanced trees
- Tree traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder
- Applications in search, syntax parsing, file systems
- Recursion and tree construction

#### 3. **Combinatorics**
- The Rule of Sum and Rule of Product
- Permutations and combinations
- The Binomial Theorem
- Pigeonhole principle and Inclusion-Exclusion principle
- Basic recurrence relations

#### 4. **Applications and Representations**
- Decision trees
- Network routing
- Logic gate structures
- Game theory (introductory exposure)

### Sample Problems

- Count the number of 3-digit numbers without repeating digits
- Find the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Determine if a graph has an Eulerian circuit
- Compute the number of possible outcomes in a card arrangement
- Trace a recursive binary tree traversal

## Machine Mirror

- Build efficient pathfinding for robotics or logistics
- Optimize scheduling or resource distribution
- Recognize isomorphic structures across different domains
- Use recursive patterns for problem decomposition

## Recursive Prompts

- What makes a tree different from a graph?
- How do permutations explode combinatorially?
- Why is coloring a graph so powerful for constraint solving?
- Can you transform recursive structures into iterative processes?
