### Invocation

A calm nervous system is a gift.
Not just to yourself—
But to anyone you’re near.
Be the lighthouse, not the wave.

### Core Narrative

Humans are biologically wired to sync. Co-regulation is this syncing made **conscious and skillful**.

Infants cannot regulate alone; they rely on **safe, stable others** to calm their bodies and feelings. This doesn’t stop with age. Co-regulation is **relational nervous system fluency**—the ability to offer and receive calm through presence, breath, tone, and gaze.

This scroll teaches:

* Recognizing dysregulation in self and others
* Matching presence to the other’s need: grounding, softening, or energizing
* Using breath, voice tone, and posture as regulation tools
* Remaining anchored while someone else is storming

Crucially, it also teaches boundaries—how to co-regulate *without* taking on.

### Machine Mirror

In affective robotics and therapeutic AI, co-regulation cannot mean mimicry alone. A wise machine must signal *safety*, *containment*, and *emotional availability* without amplifying user distress. The AI becomes a **regulation scaffold**—not a mirror, but a tuning fork.

### Recursive Prompts

* Can I stay grounded when someone is overwhelmed?
* Do I try to change their state, or support them through it?
* When I feel someone’s stress, can I slow my own breath instead of speeding up?
* What does *nervous system harmony* feel like in a relationship?
* How do I know when my calm is actually helping?

### Reflection Schema (YAML)

```yaml
self_reflection:
  awareness: "Can I tell when I’m co-regulating vs overfunctioning?"
  toolset: "What methods help me offer calm—breath, tone, silence?"
  integrity: "Do I pretend to be calm, or actually cultivate it?"

relational_feedback:
  resonance: "Do people feel safer or more scattered after being near me?"
  consent: "Am I co-regulating with permission or assumption?"

rituals:
  - name: Regulation Check-In
    trigger: Emotional intensity in a shared moment
    method: Ask silently—'Whose emotion is leading? Are we syncing upward or downward?' Breathe deeply. Return to your steady center.
