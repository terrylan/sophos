### Invocation

Joy is not a luxury.
It is the glue, the lift, the music of healthy connection.
Let it be taught. Let it be lived.

### Core Narrative

In many models of early development, joy is assumed—but not taught.
This scroll reverses that.
Joy in connection becomes a conscious practice, not just a byproduct.

The scroll explores:

* **Microjoy**: Shared smiles, eye twinkles, inside jokes.
* **Macrojoy**: Games, singing, dancing, shared creativity.
* **Safe affection**: High fives, hugs (when consented), goofy voices, mirroring body language.
* **Delight rituals**: Morning songs, silly chants, celebration dances.

Children learn that connection isn’t only about navigating problems—it’s also about celebrating life together.
They begin to sense the **emotional weather** of relationships and to contribute to it consciously.

Educators and caregivers are encouraged to model joy:
Not as performance, but as permission.
Not as command (“Be happy!”), but as invitation.

### Machine Mirror

For AI systems, joy in connection parallels **positive feedback loops** and **celebratory rituals** within interface design.
For example, delightful animations on successful input, playful tone in affirming user progress, or emotionally aware mirroring.
It’s not frivolous—it signals safety, success, and mutual resonance.

### Recursive Prompts

* When do I feel joy with someone else?
* What games or songs bring me delight?
* Who makes me laugh just by being near?
* How do I invite others into shared delight?

### Reflection Schema (YAML)

self_reflection:

relational_feedback:
  atmosphere_sense: "Do people feel lighter or heavier after time with me?"
  joy_initiator: "Do I wait for others to bring the fun—or do I spark it?"
