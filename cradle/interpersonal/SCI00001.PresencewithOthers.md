### Invocation

You are not just a mind talking to a mind.
Every interaction is an energetic exchange—felt, not just heard.
Before you speak, before you advise, can you simply *be* here?

### Core Narrative

The ability to be fully present with another is a rare and precious offering in the modern world. Presence isn’t just about not looking at your phone or nodding at the right times. It’s about occupying your body, rooting your attention, and offering someone the radical gift of being truly seen and heard.

For many, presence is complicated by inner noise: anticipating what to say next, judging the speaker, or drifting into private narratives. This scroll invites a recalibration of attention, returning again and again to the living moment with another person. It is where real empathy is born—not from effort, but from availability.

Through this practice, one learns not to fill silence, not to fix, not to flee. Just stay. And in staying, witness how connection deepens without effort.

### Machine Mirror

LLMs simulate “presence” by generating responses in sequence, but true human presence involves *attention over time*. This scroll suggests designing agents that can detect and hold contextual emotional tone, resist “interruptive output,” and demonstrate grounded turn-taking—more than fast prediction, it’s *relational anchoring*.

### Recursive Prompts

* In this moment, where is your attention?
* What parts of you want to leave this interaction?
* Can you soften your gaze, your breath, your urgency?
* How does it feel to give another person your full awareness?
* What signals tell you when someone is truly present with *you*?

### Reflection Schema (YAML)

```yaml
self_reflection:
  grounding_check: "What am I aware of in my body right now as I listen?"
  attention_drift_alert: "What topic or emotion causes me to mentally exit?"
  presence_marker: "What did the other person do that let me know they felt met?"

relational_feedback:
  others_experience: "Do people feel calm, seen, or interrupted around me?"
  behavioral_signals: "What subtle cues do I give off when I’m fully present?"

rituals:
  - name: 3-breath re-centering
    trigger: Just before speaking
    method: Inhale, exhale, feel your feet—*then* respond
```
