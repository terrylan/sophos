### Invocation

A feeling is not a flaw.
A need is not a weakness.
To name them both is to build a bridge.

### Core Narrative

Before we can connect, we must speak the language of the heart.
Naming feelings and needs is the **root system** of relational honesty.

This scroll introduces foundational NVC fluency:

* **Feelings**: Recognizing and naming what is alive within—joy, fear, anger, grief—not as judgments but as *data points* of inner experience.
* **Needs**: Identifying the unmet human needs behind the feelings—connection, safety, autonomy, belonging.

Children often internalize that emotions are too much, or that needs make them weak. This scroll deconstructs those myths, replacing them with compassionate fluency. We model how to say:

* “I feel overwhelmed, and I need space to breathe.”
* “I’m frustrated because I need clarity.”
* “I’m excited and would love to celebrate with someone.”

The focus is **clarity without blame**—offering what’s true without weaponizing it.

### Machine Mirror

An empathetic system must distinguish between surface affect and deeper unmet need. Beyond sentiment analysis, it learns to ask: “What’s behind this emotion?” True AI empathy isn’t reactive—it’s needs-aware, offering suggestions or reflections based on human motivation layers, not just moods.

### Recursive Prompts

* What am I feeling right now? What word fits?
* Is this feeling connected to a met or unmet need?
* When I hear others express strong emotions, can I guess the need underneath?
* Have I ever felt punished for expressing a need? How did that shape me?

### Reflection Schema (YAML)

```yaml
self_reflection:
  emotional_clarity: "Do I pause to name my own emotions in the moment?"
  need_connection: "Can I link my feelings to universal human needs?"
  vulnerability_practice: "Am I willing to express a need without demanding?"

relational_feedback:
  reception: "How do others respond when I share feelings clearly?"
  modeling: "Am I giving others permission to express themselves by going first?"

rituals:
  - name: Feelings & Needs Check-In
    trigger: Daily reflection or moments of tension
    method: Pause. Choose one feeling word and one need word from a list. Speak aloud: 'I feel ___ because I need ___.'
```
