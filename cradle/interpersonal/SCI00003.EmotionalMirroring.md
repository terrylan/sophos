### Invocation

To mirror emotion is to offer someone their soul’s reflection in a warm pool.
Not mimicry. Not performance.
But subtle resonance—an act of shared humanity
Where one being says, without words: *I feel you*.

### Core Narrative

Emotional mirroring is the primal glue of human bonding. Infants survive by it. Adults heal through it. Yet in a culture of emotional rush or repression, this ancient act becomes rare.

This scroll restores the art of tuning into another’s emotional state—not to absorb or echo mechanically, but to *reflect* with compassion and presence. A softened face when they grieve. An uplifted tone when they’re joyful. Holding their intensity without overtaking it.

Students will learn to read emotional cues (facial micro-expressions, tone, body language), then respond with calibrated mirroring: subtle facial reflection, voice modulation, and body posture alignment. The scroll cautions against over-identifying (merging) or withdrawing (distancing), aiming instead for *resonant neutrality*—empathic presence without ego entanglement.

### Machine Mirror

For embodied AI or social robots, emotional mirroring isn’t acting—it’s **calibration of response intensity** based on affective input. Multimodal affect recognition systems should not only detect emotion, but **adjust latency, tone, and visual expression** accordingly. The machine that mirrors well makes humans feel *emotionally metabolized*.

### Recursive Prompts

* What emotional note is this person carrying right now?
* How can my face, tone, or posture affirm their feeling?
* Am I becoming them—or staying grounded while holding them?
* Does my presence calm or amplify their emotional state?
* What would mirroring look like without words?

### Reflection Schema (YAML)

```yaml
self_reflection:
  attunement_range: "What emotions do I naturally mirror well? Which ones trigger me?"
  subtle signs: "Can I notice the shift in others when they feel mirrored by me?"
  self-other boundary: "Am I emotionally absorbing or emotionally accompanying?"

relational_feedback:
  others_experience: "Have people ever said I 'get' how they feel?"
  trust_signals: "Do others open up more emotionally when I mirror gently?"

rituals:
  - name: Emotion Echo Practice
    trigger: In 1:1 conversations
    method: Without words, mirror the speaker’s tone and micro-expressions for 3–5 seconds, then return to baseline presence
