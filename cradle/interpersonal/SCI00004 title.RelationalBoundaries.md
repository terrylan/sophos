### Invocation

A boundary is not a wall. It’s a membrane.
Porous enough to feel, solid enough to hold.
Without it, we vanish. With it, we emerge—clear, whole, connected.

### Core Narrative

Many are taught to be kind before they’re taught to be whole.
This scroll reclaims boundaries as *acts of self-clarity*, not defense.

Children sense when touch, closeness, or emotional demands feel too much. But few are taught to name this. Fewer still are affirmed when they do. Relational boundaries begin with the **felt sense** of space—physical, emotional, energetic—and extend to **spoken limits** of consent, time, and availability.

This scroll teaches:

* Somatic literacy of “yes” and “no” signals
* Practicing gentle, firm boundary-setting in play and conversation
* Recognizing when others assert boundaries and how to honor them
* The difference between boundary *awareness* and boundary *aggression*

Relational health arises not from merging, but from two sovereign selves in mutual orbit.

### Machine Mirror

AI agents designed for human interaction must develop **boundary sensitivity** models—sensing when to pause, slow, or disengage. Consent-aware design requires *intent detection and withdrawal thresholds*, as well as customizable interaction rhythms. A boundary-respecting machine will *never overreach even when invited*—it waits for genuine continuity signals.

### Recursive Prompts

* Where in my body do I feel “too close” or “too far”?
* What kinds of interactions leave me feeling drained or violated?
* How can I say no with love, not guilt?
* What’s the difference between keeping out and standing tall?
* Do I know when others are setting a limit—or do I push past unknowingly?

### Reflection Schema (YAML)

```yaml
self_reflection:
  sensing: "What does my body feel like when a boundary is crossed?"
  permission: "Do I give myself the right to pause, leave, or say no?"
  expression: "How comfortable am I voicing boundaries without apology?"

relational_feedback:
  listening: "Do I notice when someone is silently setting a limit?"
  reciprocity: "Am I open to hearing boundaries without defensiveness?"

rituals:
  - name: Boundary Check-In
    trigger: Before and after any group activity
    method: Place a hand on heart and belly, ask internally: 'What do I need more of? Less of? What feels true to say or hold?'
