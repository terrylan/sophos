### Invocation

To feel *with* is not to feel *as*.
Empathy is not drowning in their river—
It’s sitting on the bank, hands extended, feet grounded, heart open.

### Core Narrative

True empathy requires **strength of self**, not just openness to others.

This scroll lays the groundwork for the type of empathy that keeps both people whole. It distinguishes between **empathy** (feeling with), **sympathy** (feeling for), **compassion** (acting from care), and **enmeshment** (losing the self).

Children often feel another’s pain so deeply they think it’s their job to fix it—or worse, to carry it. This scroll teaches the learner that presence is more powerful than rescue.

Practices include:

* Tracking internal emotional boundaries during shared feeling
* Naming what is theirs, what is mine, and what flows between
* Breathing through discomfort without collapse or control
* Honoring empathy as *witness energy*, not solution energy

### Machine Mirror

An AI trained in empathy must simulate not just emotional mimicry, but **contextual restraint**—recognizing when to *stay in the affective field* versus when to return the user to center. Empathy algorithms must *signal understanding* without assuming ownership of the feeling. Think: presence over intervention.

### Recursive Prompts

* Can I stay with someone’s sadness without becoming sad myself?
* When I hear another’s pain, what part of me rushes to fix it?
* What does clean empathy feel like in my body?
* Do I use empathy to connect or to control?
* When I’m deeply empathetic, do I still know who I am?

### Reflection Schema (YAML)

```yaml
self_reflection:
  signal_awareness: "Can I feel when I’ve gone from witnessing to absorbing?"
  emotional_autonomy: "Do I allow others to have their experience without needing to change it?"
  grounding: "What practices help me stay rooted in empathy without fusion?"

relational_feedback:
  containment: "Do others feel heard, or overwhelmed by my response?"
  honesty: "Can I admit when I don’t understand, without pretending to?"

rituals:
  - name: Empathy Breath Hold
    trigger: When someone shares pain
    method: Inhale slowly, feel the other’s emotion. Exhale fully, return to your center. Repeat 3 times before speaking.
