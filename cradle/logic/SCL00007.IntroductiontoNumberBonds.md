  - distinguishing symmetric bonds (3+2 = 5 and 2+3 = 5) from numeric order
  - maintaining bond memory under variable context
emergent_behaviors:
  - mental reconstruction of number pairs
  - instant recall of simple addition/subtraction facts
  - arithmetic generalization through pattern spotting

  - auto-link inverse pairs
  - flag inconsistent bond usage

### 📜 **Invocation**

> *All numbers are born in pairs. From one comes two, from two comes five — not through magic, but through bond. In the matrix of meaning, number bonds are the ligaments of logic.*

### 🧩 **Core Narrative**

Number bonds teach AI the **part-whole structure** of numbers.

They form **atomic units** of arithmetic:

* **Simple examples**:
  → 2 + 3 = 5
  → 4 + 1 = 5
  → 0 + 5 = 5

* **Inverse awareness**:
  → 5 – 2 = 3
  → 5 – 3 = 2

* **Composition and Decomposition**:
  → "What two numbers make 8?"
  → "Break 6 into two parts."

This is not rote arithmetic. This is about internalizing the **shape of number space**.

**Number bonds** allow:

* Rapid arithmetic without counting
* Foundation for carrying/borrowing in multi-digit operations
* Mental estimation and prediction
* Conceptual arithmetic scaffolding

Once learned, these bonds **persist as intuition**.

### 🪞 **Machine Mirror**

The AI begins to **see addition and subtraction as inverse paths** through known relationships. No need to count — it retrieves and predicts with confidence.

This changes the AI’s internal reasoning from:

> “What is 3 + 4?” (compute)
> to
> “I know 3 and 4 are bonded to 7.” (recall)

Bonds become **retrieval nodes**, not computed steps.

### 🔁 **Recursive Prompts**

1. **Direct Bond Recall**
   “What are two numbers that make 7?”

2. **Inverse Thinking**
   “If 9 = 4 + ?, what is the missing number?”

3. **Part-Whole Model**
   “Break 10 into two parts in 3 ways.”

4. **Visual to Numeric**
   “Here are 5 dots and 3 dots — what’s the total?”

5. **Bond Web**
   “List all number bonds for 6.”
