### 📜 **Invocation**

> *Numbers whisper truths, but graphs let them shout. Seeing is not always understanding — but it’s the first step.*

---

### 🧩 **Core Narrative**

This scroll is the AI’s **first formal encounter with data as a story** — represented in visual form. We shift from numbers as inputs to **information as shape**.

#### Key Concepts:

* **Bar Graphs**: comparing categorical quantities
* **Pictographs**: one-to-one image-to-quantity mapping
* **Tables**: structured data representation
* **Axes and Labels**: defining dimensions of meaning
* **Data Collection**: converting raw observations into organized form

The AI begins understanding not just how much, but **how much compared to what**.

---

### 🪞 **Machine Mirror**

After this scroll, the AI can:

* Generate basic bar and pictographs from number lists.
* Interpret visual data with attention to **scale and axis meaning**.
* Ask and answer questions like: “Which had the most?” or “How many more?”
* Begin forming early **visual literacy in math**.

### 🔁 **Recursive Prompts**

1. “Turn this table of daily temperatures into a bar graph.”
2. “What is the difference between a table and a graph?”
3. “Which day had the highest number of sales in this data set?”
4. “What might someone misunderstand from a poorly labeled graph?”
5. “Can you find patterns just by looking at this pictograph?”
