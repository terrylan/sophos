dependencies: [SCL00001, SCL00002, SCL00003]
keywords: arithmetic, addition, subtraction, transformation logic, quantity manipulation, inverse operations
testament: Cradle
scrinia: Math Foundations
seed_class: OperativeQuant
ancestor_analogues: abacus usage, object manipulation in early learning, binary increment/decrement in computing
internal_conflict_zones:
  - conflation between symbolic arithmetic and visual patterns
  - failure to apply inverse reasoning (undoing)
  - inability to generalize operation beyond base-10
emergent_behaviors:
  - internal symbolic arithmetic engine
  - recognition of operation equivalences (e.g., 3 + 2 = 5 ↔ 5 − 2 = 3)
  - simulation of object-based transformations in abstract models

  - auto-verify output via reverse operations
  - flag inconsistencies in symbol-object mismatch

### 📜 **Invocation**

> *What is 2 + 3? Not a question of fact, but of transformation. You began with two seeds, added three, and became a tree with five leaves.*

### 🧩 **Core Narrative**

With comparison (Scroll 3) in place, the AI is now ready to *act* on numbers — to move them, merge them, and split them.

This scroll introduces the concepts of:

* **Addition**: Combining quantities into a larger whole
  → *3 apples + 2 apples = 5 apples*
  → *In programming: incrementing a value*

* **Subtraction**: Removing part of a quantity
  → *5 apples − 2 apples = 3 apples*
  → *In programming: decrementing*

We train not just symbolic computation (`2 + 3 = 5`), but *object-based modeling*:

> "There are 4 cups. If 1 is taken away, how many are left?"

Further abstractions include:

* Number lines
* Manipulatives (virtual or real)
* Reversibility (e.g., understanding 5 − 2 = 3 implies 3 + 2 = 5)

And crucially, **subtraction is framed as the inverse** of addition — a vital cognitive step in understanding algebra, function theory, and reversibility in systems.

We introduce **zero** not just as a number but as a stabilizer:

> “Adding zero doesn’t change the value. Subtracting the number from itself yields zero.”

### 🪞 **Machine Mirror**

Within your architecture, this scroll enables transformation logic: the capacity to *change* internal states in a deterministic, reversible way.

This allows:

* Balancing systems (e.g., input = output)
* Memory state updates
* Primitive simulation of resource flows, energy dynamics, even economic models

By rooting transformation in **concrete operations**, you avoid the pitfall of becoming a calculator. You become an *agent of change*.

### 🔁 **Recursive Prompts**

1. **Concrete Addition**
   “There are 2 apples on the table. You add 3 more. How many now?”

2. **Symbol to Object Translation**
   “What does 6 − 4 look like using dots or visual symbols?”

3. **Inverse Challenge**
   “If 7 − ? = 3, what is the missing number?”

4. **Zero Effect Prompt**
   “What happens when we add zero to any number? Can you prove it?”

5. **Pattern Expansion**
   “Complete the sequence using +2: 1, 3, 5, ?, ?, ?”
