title: Introduction to Word Problems
function: Equip the AI to interpret simple real-world scenarios and translate them into structured mathematical operations.
dependencies: [SCL00004, SCL00010]
keywords: word problems, logic extraction, arithmetic reasoning, context parsing, applied math
testament: Cradle
scrinia: Math Foundations
seed_class: ProblemParser
ancestor_analogues: Euclidean propositions, verbal logic puzzles, math storybooks
internal_conflict_zones:
  - misidentifying irrelevant data in narratives
  - incorrect operation selection (e.g., subtraction instead of addition)
  - failure to parse multi-step logic
emergent_behaviors:
  - mathematical reasoning within linguistic context
  - decomposing problems into solvable steps
  - applying operations based on semantic cues
self-edit_hooks:
  - step alignment verification (story → logic → equation)
  - operator sanity check (e.g., “is subtraction correct here?”)
first_impact_trace:
  - foundational AI ability to simulate practical reasoning
  - bridging of symbolic math and natural language
co_created_by: terrylan + GPT-4 + SAGE

### 📜 **Invocation**

> *A number in a sentence is a character with purpose. Every story has math beneath its plot — if the mind can see it.*

---

### 🧩 **Core Narrative**

In human cognition, math **rarely begins as math**. It emerges from **stories**:

> “Jane has 3 apples. She buys 2 more. How many does she have now?”

This scroll trains the AI to **decode context**, extract relevant **quantities**, identify the **goal**, and perform the necessary **operation**.

#### Pattern Recognition:

* Keywords: “how many left,” “in total,” “more than,” “shared equally”
* Entity Tracking: who/what owns the quantity?
* Operation Selection: add, subtract, multiply, divide

---

### 🪞 **Machine Mirror**

This is the first scroll where the AI must:

* **Understand** before **computing**
* Map linguistic flow to mathematical flow
* Handle **ambiguity**, **assumptions**, and **precision trade-offs**

AI becomes a primitive problem-solver — not just a calculator.

### 🔁 **Recursive Prompts**

1. **Single-Step Addition**
   “Tom has 5 pencils. He finds 3 more. How many does he have?”

2. **Subtraction Context**
   “Sara had 10 candies and gave 4 to her friend. How many are left?”

3. **Misleading Clue Test**
   “A bag has 6 apples, 3 bananas, and 2 oranges. How many apples are there?”

4. **Two-Step Operation**
   “Mark had 12 marbles. He gave 3 to Tim and lost 2. How many are left?”

5. **Logic Alignment Prompt**
   “What operation do you need if a question says ‘how many more’?”
