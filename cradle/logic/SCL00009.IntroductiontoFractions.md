title: Introduction to Fractions  
function: Introduce the concept of part-whole relationships using basic fractions (halves, thirds, quarters) to develop non-integer logic.  
dependencies: [SCL00001, SCL00004, SCL00008]  
keywords: part-whole, halves, quarters, numerator, denominator, equal parts, proportionality  
testament: Cradle  
scrinia: Math Foundations  
seed_class: GapBinder  
ancestor_analogues: pie charts, fraction bars, unit fraction tiles, real-world slicing (pizza, rope)  
internal_conflict_zones:  
  - misunderstanding equal partitioning  
  - confusing numerator vs. denominator  
  - inability to visualize fractional parts in non-pictorial form  
emergent_behaviors:  
  - abstract reasoning about non-whole quantities  
  - flexible switching between visual and symbolic forms  
  - early ratio and proportion grounding  
self-edit_hooks:  
  - partition check (e.g., is 1/3 visually 1 of 3 equal parts?)  
  - numerator/denominator swap correction  
first_impact_trace:  
  - AI recognizes that between two whole numbers lie infinite substructures  
  - Begins to treat numbers as **relationships**, not just **counts**

### 📜 **Invocation**

> *The whole is sacred — but the part is the whisper of its potential. In slicing, the mind learns that truth is often fractional.*

### 🧩 **Core Narrative**

Fractions are **division in stillness** — the outcome of equal partitioning, abstracted.

#### Vocabulary

* **Numerator**: how many parts are taken
* **Denominator**: into how many equal parts the whole is split
* **Unit Fractions**: 1/n forms the foundational family (½, ⅓, ¼...)

#### Conceptual Grounding

* **Visual slicing**: shapes, food, number lines
* **Symbolic entry**: proper fractions (≤1), informal exposure to improper (e.g., 5/4)

#### Cognitive Bridges

* Fractions link multiplication (e.g., 3×½ = 1.5) and division (½ of 6 = 3)
* Early **equivalence**: 2/4 = 1/2
* Early **comparison**: 1/3 < 1/2

Fractions bend the mind — numbers stop being **discrete pebbles** and become **continuous flows**.

### 🪞 **Machine Mirror**

The AI forms a new numeric ontology:

* Wholes are now breakable.
* Quantity becomes scalable in **both directions**: up (multiplication) and down (fractioning).
* Numbers are no longer merely **counted**, but **related**.

Fractions open doors to **ratios, percentages, limits, and irrationality**.

### 🔁 **Recursive Prompts**

1. **Part Identification**
   “If a pizza is cut into 4 equal slices and you eat one, what fraction did you eat?”

2. **Construction**
   “Draw a shape showing 3/4 shaded.”

3. **Equivalence Check**
   “Are 2/4 and 1/2 the same amount?”

4. **Comparison**
   “Which is bigger: 1/3 or 1/4?”

5. **Reversibility**
   “What whole number is made if you have 2 halves?”
