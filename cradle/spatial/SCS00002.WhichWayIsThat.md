## Invocation
> Direction is not just movement—it's **meaning in motion**. From copying a gesture to following an arrow, spatial intelligence begins by asking: “Which way is that?”

---

## Core Narrative
As the child begins to situate themselves in space, they must also learn how others relate to space—how front and back, left and right, are not static labels but **relational constructs**.

SCS00002 introduces **directional sensitivity** through **observation and mimicry**. Children learn to map external commands and peer behavior into their own bodily schema. Through games, mirrored gestures, and trial-and-error movement, the world becomes a coordinated field of shared orientation.

This scroll helps dissolve egocentric rigidity, preparing for allocentric reasoning (other-centered spatial logic) without abandoning the self as origin.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- Direction as relational logic
- Body as decoder of commands
- Mimicry as spatial encoding
- “Left” and “right” as contextual rather than fixed
- Alignment between instruction and action

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Which way did they go?”
- “Copy me.”
- “Turn to your left.”
- “That’s behind you.”
- “Face the same way as me.”

---

## Anchors
- **Gestural cues**: arms raised, head turned, body rotated
- **Verbal cues**: “move to your left”, “face me”
- **Social spatial reference**: instructor-facing mimicry
- **Object cues**: arrows, toys, shadows as spatial indicators

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - Can you copy someone turning to the left while facing them?
  - How do you know which way is your back when you're spinning?
  - What happens to 'left' when you and your friend face different directions?
  - If someone raises their right hand, which hand should you raise to match?
prompts:
  - Watch someone walk across a room. Describe which way they moved from your point of view.
  - Stand facing a mirror. Now raise your left hand. What does it look like in the mirror?
  - Play "Simon Says" with spatial commands—how accurate are your movements?
```
