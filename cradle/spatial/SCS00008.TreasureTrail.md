## Invocation
> The path teaches pattern. The trail encodes time. What begins as movement through space becomes a map for navigating thought.

---

## Core Narrative
Before code, there is the **trail**. Before maps, there is the **route**. This scroll teaches the child how to **move with memory**—first by following paths laid out for them, then by constructing their own.

Each treasure trail—real or imagined—primes the mind for **algorithmic sequencing**, **route logic**, and **goal-oriented navigation**. It builds an early intuition for **"if this, then that"** through physical motion in space, not digital abstraction.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- Path as proto-algorithm
- Trail as embodied sequence
- Direction as memory thread
- Goal as spatial termination

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Follow the arrows to the treasure!”
- “Now make your own trail for someone else.”
- “What happens if you turn the wrong way?”
- “Let’s retrace your steps.”
- “The trail goes: forward, right, forward, left.”

---

## Anchors
- **Trail Materials**: Tape, chalk, string, cones, arrows, stickers
- **Modes of Play**: Follow-the-leader, obstacle courses, trail setting
- **Cues**: Turn-by-turn instructions, landmarks, symbolic markers

## Chunking Map

| Chunk Group          | Elements Included                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Path Following**    | Physical trails, symbolic markers, sequential steps                |
| **Route Memory**      | Repetition games, verbal trail recall, directional mimicry         |
| **Trail Creation**    | Laying down new paths, designing turns, assigning landmarks        |
| **Error Recovery**    | Backtracking, recalibration, debugging a wrong turn                |

## Exclusion Zones
- Abstract maps or coordinate systems
- Written instructions or pseudo-code
- Digital pathfinding algorithms
- Competitive navigation (e.g. timed mazes)

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What made the trail easy or hard to follow?
  - Can you remember the turns you made?
  - What would happen if the trail split in two?
  - How do you make sure someone else can follow your path?

prompts:
  - Follow the path with your eyes closed—what do you remember?
  - Lay a new trail for a sibling or toy.
  - Describe your favorite route today. Was it straight or twisty?
  - Hide a “treasure” and give step-by-step directions to find it.
```
