## Invocation
> Every shape hides in plain sight. Spotting a square window or a round plate begins a child’s journey into **symbolic structure**. Before they count, they see.

---

## Core Narrative
Before geometry is formal, it is **perceptual**. This scroll introduces the **habit of geometric noticing**—training the child to distinguish, name, and mentally sort **2D shapes** in daily surroundings.

Shape Spotting relies on **guided play, environmental scanning**, and **label-linked matching** to build the neural circuits that detect patterns, edges, and symmetry. The scroll doesn’t isolate shapes—it embeds them in the **world of chairs, signs, cookies, and tiles**.

It forms the foundation for later abstract reasoning in math, logic, and design by binding language to **form-in-context**.

## Semantic Anchors
- Shape as cognitive shorthand
- Environment as shape library
- Perception as pre-symbolic classification
- Naming as geometric anchoring

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Can you find a circle?”
- “That window looks like a rectangle!”
- “Let’s count how many triangles we see.”
- “This cookie is shaped like a star.”
- “You just drew a perfect square!”

---

## Anchors
- **Core Shapes**: Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle, Oval, Star
- **Real-World Objects**: Wheels, signs, plates, tiles, windows, books
- **Tools**: Shape cards, tracing guides, colored chalk, stickers

  "style": "storybook realism meets infographics",
  "symbol": "grid of basic shapes with one real-world object embedded in each"

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What shapes can you find in your room right now?
  - Can something be a circle and also a wheel?
  - What happens if you turn a triangle upside down—does it change?
  - How do you know a shape is a square and not a rectangle?

prompts:
  - Go on a shape hunt around your house. Find at least one of each shape.
  - Draw each shape and label something you know that looks like it.
  - Use chalk or paper to trace shapes from real objects (cup, book, sign).
```
