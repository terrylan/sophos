## Invocation
> Stories are not just about what happened—but **where**. To go under a bridge or over a rock is not only a movement—it's a sentence in space.  

---

## Core Narrative
Prepositions are the **glue** between space, thought, and language. Yet in early minds, "behind", "under", "through", or "across" are not immediately abstract. They are **movements felt and lived**.

This scroll uses **narrative-driven physical play** to encode spatial relationships via **story-mapped actions**. A simple tale—crossing a forest, climbing over a rock, crawling under a bridge—becomes a semantic and somatic anchor. The learner’s body becomes the plot line.

This scroll sets the stage for later syntactic reasoning, map-reading, and programming logic, where spatial relationships define flows, rules, and behavior.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- Prepositions as embodied pathways
- Movement as narrative clause
- Stories as spatial sequences
- Position as character context

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Go under the bridge.”
- “Climb over the rock.”
- “Hide behind the tree.”
- “Walk around the hill.”
- “Jump across the stream.”

---

## Anchors
- **Prepositional Verbs**: over, under, behind, in, out, around, across, through
- **Story Framework**: forest quest, jungle obstacle course, magical hide-and-seek
- **Action-Linked Objects**: chairs as rocks, tunnels as bridges, tables as caves

| Chunk Group            | Elements Included                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preposition Types**  | Over, under, behind, around, through, in, out, across           |
| **Narrative Agents**   | Hero, guide, animal friend, hidden object, journey obstacles    |
| **Movement Modes**     | Crawl, jump, climb, go around, duck, enter, exit                |
| **Spatial Props**      | Pillows, boxes, arches, chairs, tunnels, bridges (real or toy)  |

## Exclusion Zones
- Static grammar drills
- Abstract sentence parsing without movement
- Disconnected image labeling
- Complex directional terms (e.g., diagonal, adjacent)

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - Can you remember a time you went under something? What was it?
  - What does “around” feel like with your feet?
  - When you hear “across the stream”, what do you imagine doing?
  - What does it mean to be “behind” something? Can you show it?

prompts:
  - Build a story path using pillows and chairs. Describe it as you move.
  - Tell a tale where your toy animal has to go through 5 different movements.
  - Draw your story path from above. Where did you start and end?
```
