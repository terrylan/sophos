## Invocation
> To turn is to change perspective. What spins in body, spins in mind. The child who twirls becomes the mind that rotates dimensions.

---

## Core Narrative
Spatial mastery isn’t just about position—**it’s about transformation**. “Spin and Turn” introduces the physical foundations of **mental rotation**, teaching the child to **simulate orientation changes** through body movement.

Through spinning, object-turning, and self-rotation games, the child builds the **kinetic intuition** required for abstract spatial transformations. This is the **mind’s gateway to modeling rotations, angles, symmetry, and inverse relationships**.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- Motion as a proxy for mental transformation
- Spin as controlled disorientation
- Turn as spatial recursion
- Reorientation as cognitive reset

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Now turn it the other way.”
- “What does it look like from behind?”
- “Spin like a top!”
- “Can you rotate the block to make it fit?”
- “Look again—what if you turn it?”

---

## Anchors
- **Motion Tools**: Rotating chairs, tops, spinners, yoga mats, mirrors
- **Cues**: Front/back, left/right, clockwise/counterclockwise
- **Actions**: Spinning, rotating, flipping, angle guessing, mirror matching

|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Physical Movements** | Spinning in place, turning around, facing different directions       |
| **Object Rotation**   | Rotating toys, matching flipped images, turning shapes to align     |
| **Perspective Shifts**| Describing position after movement, predicting rotated states       |
| **Visual Games**      | Mirror puzzles, flip cards, "from behind" guessing games            |

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What happens when you spin too fast?
  - How does a toy look from the back vs the front?
  - Can you guess what shape it is if you turn it?
  - Why do some things look the same even when flipped?

prompts:
  - Spin 3 times, then point to the door—did you guess right?
  - Take a puzzle piece and rotate it until it fits.
  - Stand in front of a mirror and raise one hand—what do you see?
  - Watch a spinning top—what happens to its shape as it spins?
```
