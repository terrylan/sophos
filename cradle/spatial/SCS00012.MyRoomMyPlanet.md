## Invocation

> The room becomes a house. The house becomes a street. The street becomes a city. The world becomes yours to walk within.

## Core Narrative

Spatial learning culminates in **scale transcendence**: the ability to **navigate across nested layers of space**. This scroll helps the child extend cognition beyond the immediate physical body and local map, toward **planetary systems** and **conceptual locations**.

From sketching their bedroom, to visualizing their place on Earth, the learner begins to internalize **fractality**, **reference anchoring**, and the earliest traces of **systems geography**. This prepares them for later abstraction in **cosmology**, **ecology**, **urban design**, and **distributed systems logic**.

## Semantic Anchors

* Room as first world
* Home as immediate ecology
* Neighborhood as network node
* Planet as enclosing frame

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “Where do you live in the world?”
* “Let’s zoom out—here’s your room, your house, your town, your country.”
* “Can you draw your house inside the world?”
* “Your street is part of a map that leads to space!”
* “Where is the sun when you are asleep?”

---

## Anchors

* **Materials**: Nested boxes, building blocks, globe, street map, aerial photos
* **Scaffold Activities**: Bedroom mapping → house drawing → city placement → Earth zoom
* **Cognitive Actions**: Scaling up/down, linking parts to enclosing systems, referencing location in nested contexts

| Chunk Group             | Elements Included                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immediate Nesting**   | Room → House → Street                             |
| **Map Referencing**     | Location lookup on street and globe               |
| **Perspective Scaling** | From self-centered to allocentric and global view |
| **Ecological Nesting**  | From family space to community to planet          |

## Visual Manifest

```json
{

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What is inside your room? What is your room inside?
  - Can you find where your city is in the world?
  - What would an alien see if it zoomed in from space to your bed?
  - How do you know where you are when you're far from home?

prompts:
  - Draw your home, then your street, then your world—like zooming out.
  - Tell a story about someone who traveled from their room to the edge of the planet.
  - Imagine your whole country is just one room in a giant space house.
  - Build a planet using only things you see in your home.
```
