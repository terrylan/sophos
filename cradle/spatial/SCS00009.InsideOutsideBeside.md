## Invocation
> What lives beside, belongs together. What’s inside, stays remembered. Every object teaches a relationship. Every relation whispers a logic.

---

## Core Narrative
Spatial understanding begins with proximity, but **relational cognition** is born when the child can **label and manipulate positions**—inside the box, outside the circle, beside the bear.

This scroll builds the vocabulary of **containment**, **adjacency**, and **relational identity**, which are the **pre-mathematical structures** of reasoning and classification. Before a child learns about Venn diagrams or logic gates, they must understand **where things are, relative to one another**.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- “Inside” as containment schema
- “Outside” as exclusion marker
- “Beside” as adjacency signal
- Spatial prepositions as logical operators

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Put the red ball inside the basket.”
- “Which toy is beside the doll?”
- “Let’s find what’s outside the circle.”
- “Is the cat under or beside the table?”
- “Everything inside the box goes to sleep.”

---

## Anchors
- **Object Sets**: Toys, containers, boxes, rings, mats, ropes
- **Spatial Zones**: Inside/outside lines, mats with marked regions, labeled containers
- **Terms Introduced**: In, out, on, under, over, near, far, beside, behind

| Chunk Group        | Elements Included                                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Containment**     | Putting objects inside/into containers or shapes                   |
| **Exclusion**       | Identifying what doesn’t belong in a space                         |
| **Adjacency**       | Placing items beside or near each other with intent                |
| **Prepositional Play** | Using physical movement to embody positional terms             |

## Exclusion Zones
- Abstract set notation (∈, ⊂)
- Formal logic symbols or math gates
- Programming conditionals (if-in, else-out)
- Digital simulations of containers (saved for Primer)

## Visual Manifest

```json
{
  "scene": "A child arranges colorful toys on a large mat divided into zones labeled 'Inside', 'Outside', and 'Beside'. A plush bear sits beside a red ball, which is inside a translucent cube. An arrow points to a toy just outside a circle.",
  "colors": ["soft contrasts for zones", "clear shape boundaries", "playful but crisp visual language"],
  "style": "diagrammatic realism with toy aesthetics",
  "symbol": "a cube enclosing a sphere, beside a triangle just outside a dotted ring"
}

    "Verbally tag object positions using prepositions",
    "Use spatial relations to sort, classify, and pattern"
  ],

```

---

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What’s the difference between inside and beside?
  - Can something be beside and outside at the same time?
  - Why do we say something is 'in' a group?
  - How do we know if something doesn’t belong?

prompts:
  - Find 3 toys and place one inside a box, one beside the box, and one outside the circle.
  - Ask someone to hide a toy and describe where it is using clues.
  - Create a story about a creature that only lives beside other things.
  - Group objects based on whether they’re inside, outside, or neither.
```
