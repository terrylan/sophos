## Invocation

> A mark becomes a mountain. A line becomes a journey. The map is not the world—but it helps us move through it.

---

## Core Narrative

With this scroll, the child begins to **abstract space into symbol**. Physical paths become **drawn lines**. Landmarks become **icons**. Spatial memory is externalized into **representational form**, enabling planning, explanation, and shared navigation.

This is where the **roots of cartography**, **graph theory**, and **programmatic pathing** begin—not with scale and legend, but with a child tracing their route to grandma’s room.

---

## Semantic Anchors

* Symbol as spatial stand-in
* Map as portable landscape
* Key as decoder of representation
* Path as narrative of movement

---

## Canonical Phrases

* “Draw how you got there.”
* “X marks the treasure.”
* “This square is the house, and the circle is the tree.”
* “Follow the arrow from here to the park.”
* “Let’s make a map so we don’t get lost.”

---

## Anchors

* **Materials**: Paper maps, markers, chalk trails, stickers, string mazes
* **Symbols Introduced**: X for location, → for direction, O for object, color codes
* **Actions**: Drawing, marking, following, decoding, route storytelling

## Chunking Map

| Chunk Group             | Elements Included                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symbolic Marking**    | X marks, arrows, circles representing real-world places   |
| **Path Representation** | Drawing a route with turns, decisions, and features       |
| **Legend and Keys**     | Assigning meanings to symbols, creating a decoding system |
| **Route Explanation**   | Explaining how a drawn map corresponds to physical space  |

---

## Exclusion Zones

* Coordinate systems (x/y axes)
* Scaled geography
* Compass and angle math
* Procedural map generation (saved for Ascent or Master)

## Visual Manifest

```json
{
  "scene": "A child draws a map showing their bedroom, the hallway, and the kitchen. Symbols like a star for a door and X for treasure are used. The map sits beside a string trail on the floor that mirrors it. An adult asks, 'How do I get to the cookies?'",
  "colors": ["marker tones (blue, red, green)", "icon overlays", "dashed paths"],
  "style": "playful top-down schematic with child-style line art and legend",
  "symbol": "X inside a square, connected to a circle via a dashed line with an arrow"
}
```

    "Use maps to plan or recall navigation"
  ],
  "learning_goals": [
    "Bridge embodied space with symbolic thinking",

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What does the X mean on your map?
  - Can you follow a path you drew yesterday?
  - What happens if someone reads your map wrong?
  - Is a picture of a house the same as a house?

prompts:
  - Draw a map of your favorite place and add a key to explain your symbols.
  - Create a treasure trail and give someone the map to find it.
  - Tell a story about a place using only shapes and lines.
  - Imagine a world where every step leaves a mark—what map would your day make?
```
