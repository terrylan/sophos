## Invocation
> A tower rises. A tunnel beckons. One draws upward toward sky, the other downward into mystery. Together they teach what presence alone cannot—**volume**.

---

## Core Narrative
Most spatial learning begins in two dimensions. This scroll introduces the **third axis**—depth and height—by engaging the child in **constructive and immersive play**.

Towers teach stacking, balance, height estimation, and sequential logic. Tunnels, on the other hand, introduce negative space, **containment**, and ideas of passage. Together, they encode the **solid-void dialectic**, training an embodied understanding of **form versus function**, and laying the groundwork for both **design thinking** and **topological awareness**.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- Height as logic of layers
- Tunnel as memory of enclosure
- Construction as pre-architecture
- Void as conceptual space

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “How tall can you go before it falls?”
- “Can you crawl through without touching the sides?”
- “That’s a tunnel! It goes all the way through.”
- “Build it wide enough for your toy to pass.”
- “This tower touches the sky!”

---

## Anchors
- **Construction Tools**: Blocks, boxes, cushions, recycled materials
- **Void Markers**: Tunnels, gaps, crawlspaces, stacked arches
- **Actions**: Stacking, enclosing, crawling, observing collapse

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - What’s the tallest tower you’ve built that didn’t fall?
  - Can you build something a toy can go through?
  - What makes something a tunnel and not just a space?
  - Is a cave a tunnel? Is a box with holes?

prompts:
  - Use blocks to build a tower taller than your hand.
  - Make a tunnel for a toy car and test if it fits.
  - Try building something you can crawl through.
  - Stack soft things until they wobble—what keeps it steady?
```
