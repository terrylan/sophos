## Invocation
> Before maps, we need a point of origin. Before logic, we need orientation. Before we go anywhere, we must feel: **here I am.**

---

## Core Narrative
Every spatial system, from a child’s room to a cosmic simulation, requires an anchor. This scroll implants the foundational awareness that **"I exist somewhere."** It fuses proprioception (the felt sense of body position) with emerging locational identity.

This is the **zero-point** of all future coordinates, systems, and metaphors. The body is not simply in space; it is the **reference for space**.

Scroll SCS00001 opens the spatial domain by rooting cognition in felt position, directional awareness, and ego-centric mapping. It frames the child’s own body as the **center of the known world**, from which all directions, relationships, and environments emerge.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- "Here" as existential center
- Body as spatial origin
- Self-orientation before navigation
- Internal vs external direction
- Embodied reference frame

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Here I am.”
- “This is me.”
- “Up, down, left, right—from me.”
- “I feel where I am.”
- “I know where I begin.”

---

## Anchors
- **Body-centered vocabulary**: "my left hand", "in front of me", "above my head"
- **Motion cues**: "turn around", "step forward", "reach out"
- **Sensory orientation**: visual field, tactile feedback, pressure awareness

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - Can you point to your left hand without looking?
  - What is behind you right now?
  - When you turn around, what happens to 'left' and 'right'?
  - Can you feel where you are in space without touching anything?
prompts:
  - Close your eyes. Now move your arms in different directions. Describe what you feel.
  - Imagine the space around you as lines from your body outward. What shape is it?
  - Try to turn slowly in a circle. What direction are you now facing?
