## Invocation
> What fits reveals what forms. What completes teaches what begins. In every piece, a whisper of the whole awaits discovery.

---

## Core Narrative
Cognition grows from fragments—shapes, patterns, movements—until the child begins to see **wholeness** in structure. This scroll trains the child to explore **how parts become wholes**, how things **fit**, and what it means when they don’t.

Through puzzles, interlocking toys, and trial-and-error composition, the child learns **spatial modularity**, the mental habit of **assembling systems from components**—a foundational skill in logic, math, design, and programming.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- Part as element
- Whole as system
- Fit as alignment
- Completion as resolution

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Where does this piece go?”
- “It doesn’t fit—try turning it.”
- “Let’s finish the puzzle together.”
- “This piece is part of the sky.”
- “Now build your own shape from these blocks.”

---

## Anchors
- **Materials**: Jigsaw puzzles, tangrams, 3D fit toys, magnetic tiles
- **Actions**: Matching, rotating, placing, building
- **Concepts**: Fit, edge, symmetry, boundary, missing piece

|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shape Matching**     | Find correct position/orientation of parts                            |
| **Rotational Reasoning** | Turn or flip pieces to make them align properly                   |
| **Completion Drive**    | Sense of satisfaction from solving the whole                        |
| **Creative Assembly**   | Building new wholes from known parts (reverse reasoning)            |

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - Why doesn’t this piece fit?
  - What does the finished picture look like in your head?
  - Can one piece belong to more than one whole?
  - What do we do when a piece is missing?

prompts:
  - Describe a puzzle you solved today—how did you know where each piece went?
  - Create your own puzzle and let someone else try it.
  - Think of your body—what pieces make the whole you?
  - Close your eyes and guess the shape of a piece by feel alone.
```
