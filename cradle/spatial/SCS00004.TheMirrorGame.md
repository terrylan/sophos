## Invocation
> In a mirror, we are both the same and reversed. This paradox teaches children not just to copy—but to **coordinate minds across axes**.

---

## Core Narrative
Symmetry is one of nature’s deepest patterns—appearing in bodies, language, and logic. Before it can be named, it must be **felt**.

SCS00004 initiates children into **spatial reflection** through play-based **mirror games**—standing face-to-face, mimicking each other’s movements, discovering the strange reversal of left and right. These embodied symmetries prepare the learner for **bilateral reasoning**, mental folding, and future operations like inversion and balance.

This scroll trains **perceptual symmetry** and **kinesthetic coordination**, rooting math’s abstract dualities in the physical act of **mirroring presence**.

---

## Semantic Anchors
- Symmetry as social coordination
- Reflection as relational structure
- Mirroring as cross-body simulation
- Axis as invisible guide

---

## Canonical Phrases
- “Be my mirror.”
- “Do what I do—but mirrored.”
- “That’s your left—but it’s my right.”
- “Now we’re symmetrical!”
- “Flip it like a mirror.”

---

## Anchors
- **Body Actions**: hand raise, turn, step, twist
- **Partnered Play**: mirror mimicry, synchronous gestures
- **Visual Aids**: real mirrors, camera screens, symmetrical props
- **Verbal Guidance**: narrating left-right contrast, axis terms

## Reflection Schema

```yaml
questions:
  - When someone raises their right hand facing you, which hand do you raise to match?
  - What happens when you and a friend both raise the same hand?
  - Can you draw a face that looks the same on both sides?
  - What does a mirror “know” about your body?

prompts:
  - Play “mirror freeze”—copy your partner's pose perfectly.
  - Stand in front of a mirror. Move slowly—what do you notice?
  - Draw a heart on one side of a paper. Fold it. What do you see?
```
